    "text": "This is the original foreword to the 1st edition of the book. It will be revised prior to the finalization of the 2nd edition.\nOver the past decade or so, increases in compute power, emergence of friendly analytic tools and an explosion of data have created a wonderful opportunity to bring more analytical rigor to nearly every imaginable question. Not coincidentally, organizations are increasingly looking to apply all that data and capability to what is typically their greatest area of expense and their greatest strategic differentiator—their people. For too long, many of the most critical decisions in an organization—people decisions—had been guided by gut instinct or borrowed ‘best practices’ and the democratization of people analytics opened up enticing pathways to fix that. Suddenly, analysts who were originally interested in data problems began to be interested in people problems, and HR professionals who had dedicated their careers to solving people problems needed more sophisticated analysis and data storytelling to make their cases and to refine their approaches for greater efficiency, effectiveness and impact.\nDoing data work with people in organizations has complexities that some other types of data work doesn’t. Often, the employee populations are relatively smaller than data sets used in other areas, sometimes limiting the methods that can be used. Various regulatory requirements may dictate what data can be gathered and used, and what types of evidence might be required for various programs or people strategies. Human behavior and organizations are sufficiently complex that typically, multiple factors work together in influencing an outcome. Effects can be subtle or meaningful only in combination, or difficult to tease apart. While in many disciplines, prediction is the most important aim, for most people analytics projects and practitioners, understanding why something is happening is critical.\nWhile the universe of analytical approaches is wonderful and vast, the best ‘Swiss army knife’ we have in people analytics is regression. This volume is an accessible, targeted work aimed directly at supporting professionals doing people analytics work. I’ve had the privilege of knowing and respecting Keith McNulty for many years – he is the rare and marvelous individual who is deeply expert in the mechanics of data and analytics, curious about and steeped in the opportunities to improve the effectiveness and well-being of people at work, and a gifted teacher and storyteller. He is among the most prolific standard-bearers for people analytics. This new open-source volume is in keeping with many years of contributions to the practice of understanding people at work.\nAfter nearly 30 years of doing people analytics work and the privilege of leading people analytics teams at several leading global organizations, I am still excited by the problems we get to solve, the insights we get to spawn, and the tremendous impact we can have on organizations and the people that comprise them. This work is human and technical and important and exciting and deeply gratifying. I hope that you will find this Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics helps you uncover new truths and create positive impacts in your own work.\nAlexis A. Fink\nDecember 2020\nAlexis A. Fink, PhD is a leading figure in people analytics and has led major people analytics teams at Microsoft and Intel before her current role as Vice President of People Analytics and Workforce Strategy at Facebook.

    "text": "This is the original introduction to the 1st edition of the book. It will be revised prior to the finalization of the 2nd edition.\nAs a fresh-faced undergraduate in mathematics in the 1990s, I took an introductory course in statistics in my first term. I would never take another. I struggled with the subject, scored my lowest grade in it and swore I would never go anywhere near it again.\nHow wrong I was. Today I live and breathe statistics. How did that happen?\nFirstly, statistics is about solving real-world problems, and amazingly there was not a single mention of a relatable problem from real life in that course I took all those years ago, just abstract mathematics. Nowadays, I know from my work and my personal learning activities that the mathematics has no meaning without a motivating problem to apply it to, and you’ll see example problems all through this book.\nSecondly, statistics is all about data, and working with real data has encouraged me to reengage with statistics and come at it from a different angle—bottom-up you could say. Suddenly all those concepts that were put up on whiteboards using abstract formulas now had real meaning and consequence to the data I was working with. For me, real data helps statistical theory come to life, and this book is supported by numerous data sets designed for the reader to engage with.\nBut one more step solidified my newfound love of statistics, and that was when I put regression modeling into practice. Faced with data sets that I initially believed were just far too messy and random to be able to produce genuine insights, I progressively became more and more fascinated by how regression can cut through the messiness, compartmentalize the randomness and lead you straight to inferences that are often surprising both in their clarity and in their conclusions.\nHence my motivation for writing this book, which is to give others—whether working in people analytics or otherwise—a starting point for a practical learning of regression methods, with the hope that they will see immediate applications to their work and take advantage of a much-underused toolkit that provides strong support for evidence-based practice.\nI am a mathematician who is now a practitioner of analytics. For this reason you should see that this book is neither afraid of nor obsessed with the mathematics of the methodologies covered. It is my general observation that many students and practitioners make the mistake of trying to run multivariate models without even a basic understanding of the underlying mathematics of those models, and I find it very difficult to see how they can be credible in responding to a wide range of questions or critique about their work without such an understanding. That said, it is also not necessary for students and practitioners to understand the deepest levels of theory in order to be fluent in running and interpreting multivariate models. In this book I have tried to limit the mathematical exposition to a level that allows confident and fluent execution and interpretation.\nI subscribe strongly to the principles of open source sharing of knowledge. If you want to reference the material in this book or use the exercises or data sets in trainings or classes, you are free to do so and you do not need to request my permission. I only ask that you make reference to this book as the source.\nI expect this book to improve over time. If you found this book or any part of it helpful to solving a problem, I’d love to hear about it. If you have comments to improve or question any aspect of the contents of this book I encourage you to leave an issue on its Github repository. This is the most reliable way for me to see your comment. I promise to consider all comments and input, but I do have to make a personal judgment about whether they are helpful to the aims and purpose of this book. If I do make changes or additions based on your input I will make a point to acknowledge your contribution.\nI would like to thank the following individuals who have reviewed or contributed to this book at some point during its development: Liz Romero, Alex LoPilato, Kevin Jaggs, Seth Saavedra, Akshay Kotha. My sincere thanks to Alexis Fink for drawing on her years of people analytics experience to set the context for this book in her foreword. My thanks to the people analytics community for their constant encouragement and support in sharing theory, content and method, and to the R community for all the work they do in giving us amazing and constantly improving statistical tools to work with. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their patience and understanding on the evenings and weekends I dedicated to the writing of this book, and for tolerating far too much dinner conversation on the topic of statistics.\nKeith McNulty\nDecember 2020",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Why is regression modeling so important in people analytics?\nIn the 19th century, when Francis Galton first used the term ‘regression’ to describe a statistical phenomenon (see Chapter 4), little did he know how important that term would be today. Many of the most powerful tools of statistical inference that we now have at our disposal can be traced back to the types of early analysis that Galton and his contemporaries were engaged in. The sheer number of different regression-related methodologies and variants that are available to researchers and practitioners today is mind-boggling, and there are still rich veins of ongoing research that are focused on defining and refining new forms of regression to tackle new problems.\nNeither could Galton have imagined the advent of the age of data we now live in. Those of us (like me) who entered the world of work even as recently as 20 years ago remember a time when most problems could not be expected to be solved using a data-driven approach, because there simply was no data. Things are very different now, with data being collected and processed all around us and available to use as direct or indirect measures of the phenomena we are interested in.\nAlong with the growth in data that we have seen in recent years, we have also seen a rapid growth in the availability of statistical tools—open source and free to use—that fundamentally change how we go about analytics. Gone are the clunky, complex, repeated steps on calculators or spreadsheets. In their place are lean statistical programming languages that can implement a regression analysis in milliseconds with a single line of code, allowing us to easily run and reproduce multivariate analysis at scale.\nSo given that we have access to well-developed methodology, rich sources of data and readily accessible tools, it is somewhat surprising that many analytics practitioners have a limited knowledge and understanding of regression and its applications. The aim of this book is to encourage inexperienced analytics practitioners to ‘dip their toes’ further into the wide and varied world of regression in order to deliver more targeted and precise insights to their organizations and stakeholders on the problems they are most interested in. While the primary subject matter focus of this book is the analysis of people-related phenomena, the material is easily and naturally transferable to other disciplines. Therefore this book can be regarded as a practical introduction to a wide range of regression methods for any analytics student or practitioner.\nIt is my firm belief that all people analytics professionals should have a strong understanding of regression models and how to implement and interpret them in practice, and my aim with this book is to provide those who need it with help in getting there. In this chapter we will set the scene for the technical learning in the remainder of the book by outlining the relevance of regression models in people analytics practice. We also touch on some general inferential modeling theory to set a context for later chapters, and we provide a preview of the contents, structure and learning objectives of this book.\nPeople analytics involves the study of the behaviors and characteristics of people or groups in relation to important business, organizational or institutional outcomes. This can involve both qualitative methods and quantitative methods, but if data is available related to a particular topic of interest, then quantitative methods are almost always considered important. With such a specific focus on outcomes, any analyst working in people analytics will frequently need to model these outcomes both to understand what influences them and to potentially predict them in the future.\nModeling an outcome with the primary goal of understanding what influences it can be quite a different matter to modeling an outcome with the primary goal of predicting if it will happen in the future. If we need to understand what influences an outcome, we need to get inside a model and construct a formula or structure to infer how each variable acts on that outcome, we need to get a sense of which variables are meaningful or not, and we need to quantify the ‘explainability’ of the outcome based on our variables. If our primary aim is to predict the outcome, getting inside the model is less important because we don’t have to explain the outcome, we just need to be confident that it predicts accurately.\nA model constructed to understand an outcome is often called an inferential model. Regression models are the most well-known and well-used inferential models available, providing a wide range of measures and insights that help us explain the relationship between our input variables and our outcome of interest, as we shall see in later chapters of this book.\nThe current reality in the field of people analytics is that inferential models are more required than predictive models. There are two reasons for this. First, data sets in people analytics are rarely large enough to facilitate satisfactory prediction accuracy, and so attention is usually shifted to inference for this reason alone. Second, in the field of people analytics, decisions often have a real impact on individuals. Therefore, even in the rare situations where accurate predictive modeling is attainable, stakeholders are unlikely to trust the output and bear the consequences of predictive models without some sort of elementary understanding of how the predictions are generated. This requires the analyst to consider inference power as well as predictive accuracy in selecting their modeling approach. Again, many regression models come to the fore because they are commonly able to provide both inferential and predictive value.\nFinally, the growing importance of evidence-based practice in many clinical and professional fields has generated a need for more advanced modeling skills to satisfy rising demand for quantitative evidence from decision makers. In people-related fields such as human resources, many varieties of specialized regression-based models such as survival models or latent variable models have crossed from academic and clinical settings into business settings in recent years, and there is an increasing need for qualified individuals who understand and can implement and interpret these models in practice.",

    "section": "1.2 What do we mean by ‘modeling’‍?",
    "text": "1.2 What do we mean by ‘modeling’‍?\nThe term ‘modeling’ has a very wide range of meaning in everyday life and work. In this book we are focused on inferential modeling, and we define that as a specific form of statistical learning, which tries to discover and understand a mathematical relationship between a set of measurements of certain constructs and a measurement of an outcome of interest, based on a sample of data on each. Modeling is both a concept and a process.\n\n1.2.1 The theory of inferential modeling\nWe will start with a theoretical description and then provide a real example from a later chapter to illustrate.\nImagine we have a population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) for which we believe there may be a non-random relationship between a certain construct or set of constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and a certain measurable outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\). Imagine that for a certain sample \\(S\\) of observations from \\(\\mathscr{P}\\), we have a collection of data which we believe measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) to some acceptable level of accuracy, and for which we also have a measure of the outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\).\nBy convention, we denote the set of data that measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) on our sample \\(S\\) as \\(X = x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\), where each \\(x_i\\) is a vector (or column) of data measuring at least one of the constructs in \\(\\mathscr{C}\\). We denote the set of data that measure \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) on our sample set \\(S\\) as \\(y\\). An upper-case \\(X\\) is used because the expectation is that there will be several columns of data measuring our constructs, and a lower-case \\(y\\) is used because the expectation is that the outcome is a single column.\nInferential modeling is the process of learning about a relationship (or lack of relationship) between the data in \\(X\\) and \\(y\\) and using that to describe a relationship (or lack of relationship) between our constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and our outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) that is valid to a high degree of statistical certainty on the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\). This process may include:\n\nTesting a proposed mathematical relationship in the form of a function, structure or iterative method\nComparing that relationship against other proposed relationships\nDescribing the relationship statistically\nDetermining whether the relationship (or certain elements of it) can be generalized from the sample set \\(S\\) to the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\)\n\nWhen we test a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(y\\), we acknowledge that data and measurements are imperfect and so each observation in our sample \\(S\\) may contain random error that we cannot control. Therefore we define our relationship as:\n\\[\ny = f(X) + \\epsilon\n\\] where \\(f\\) is some transformation or function of the data in \\(X\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random, uncontrollable error.\n\\(f\\) can take the form of a predetermined function with a formula defined on \\(X\\), like a linear function for example. In this case we can call our model a parametric model. In a parametric model, the modeled value of \\(y\\) is known as soon as we know the values of \\(X\\) by simply applying the formula. In a non-parametric model, there is no predetermined formula that defines the modeled value of \\(y\\) purely in terms of \\(X\\). Non-parametric models need further information in addition to \\(X\\) in order to determine the modeled value of \\(y\\)—for example the value of \\(y\\) in other observations with similar \\(X\\) values.\nRegression models are designed to derive \\(f\\) using estimation based on statistical likelihood and expectation, founded on the theory of the distribution of random variables. Regression models can be both parametric and non-parametric, but by far the most commonly used methods (and the majority of those featured in this book) are parametric. Because of their foundation in statistical likelihood and expectation, they are particularly suited to helping answer questions of generalizability—that is, to what extent can the relationship being observed in the sample \\(S\\) be inferred for the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\), which is usually the driving force in any form of inferential modeling.\nNote that there is a difference between establishing a statistical relationship between \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) and establishing a causal relationship between the two. This can be a common trap that inexperienced statistical analysts fall into when communicating the conclusions of their modeling. Establishing that a relationship exists between a construct and an outcome is a far cry from being able to say that one causes the other. This is the common truism that ‘correlation does not equal causation’‍.\nTo bring our theory to life, consider the walkthrough example in Chapter 4 of this book. In this example, we discuss how to establish a relationship between the academic results of students in the first three years of their education program and their results in the fourth year. In this case, our population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) is all past, present and future students who take similar examinations, and our sample \\(S\\) is the students who completed their studies in the past three years. \\(X = x_1, x_2, x_3\\) are each of the three scores from the first three years, and \\(y\\) is the score in the fourth year. We test \\(f\\) to be a linear relationship, and we establish that such a relationship can be generalized to the entire population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) with a substantial level of statistical confidence1.\nAlmost all our work in this book will refer to the variables \\(X\\) as input variables and the variable \\(y\\) as the outcome variable. There are many other common terms for these which you may find in other sources—for example \\(X\\) are often known as independent variables or covariates while \\(y\\) is often known as a dependent or response variable.\n\n\n1.2.2 The process of inferential modeling\nInferential modeling—regression or otherwise—is a process of numerous steps. Typically the main steps are:\n\nDefining the outcome of interest \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) and the input constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) based on a broader evidence-based objective\nConfirming that \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) has reliable measurement data\nDetermining which data can be used to measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\)\nDetermining a sample \\(S\\) and collecting, refining and cleaning data.\nPerforming exploratory data analysis (EDA) and proposing a set of models to test for \\(f\\)\nPutting the data in an appropriate format for each model\nRunning the models\nInterpreting the outputs and performing model diagnostics\nSelecting an optimal model or models\nArticulating the inferences that can be generalized to apply to \\(\\mathscr{P}\\)\n\nThis book is primarily focused on steps 7–10 of this process2. That is not to say that steps 1–6 are not important. Indeed these steps are critical and often loaded with analytic traps. Defining the problem, collecting reliable measures and cleaning and organizing data are still the source of much pain and angst for analysts, but these topics are for another day.",

    "text": "1.3 The structure, system and organization of this book\nThe purpose of this book is to put inexperienced practitioners firmly on a path to the confident and appropriate use of regression techniques in their day-to-day work. This requires enough of an understanding of the underlying theory so that judgments can be made about results, but also a practical set of steps to help practitioners apply the most common regression methods to a variety of typical modeling scenarios in a reliable and reproducible way.\nIn most chapters, time is spent on the underlying mathematics. Not to the degree of an academic theorist, but enough to ensure that the reader can associate some mathematical meaning to the outputs of models. While it may be tempting to skip the math, I strongly recommend against it if you intend to be a high performer in your field. The best analysts are those who can genuinely understand what the numbers are telling them.\nThe statistical programming language R is used for most of the practical demonstration in each chapter. Because R is open source and particularly well geared to inferential statistics, it is an excellent choice for those whose work involves a lot of inferential analysis. We will also show implementations of all of the available methodologies in Python, which is also a powerful open source tool for this sort of work, and is much more popular and in the broader field of data science.\nEach chapter involves a walkthrough example to illustrate the specific method and to allow the reader to replicate the analysis for themselves. The exercises at the end of each chapter are designed so that the reader can try the same method on a different data set, or a different problem on the same data set, to test their learning and understanding. In the final chapter, a series of data sets and exercises are provided with limited instruction in order to give the reader an opportunity to test their overall knowledge in selecting and applying regression methods to a variety of people analytics data sets and problems. All in all, sixteen different data sets are used as walkthrough or exercise examples, and all of these data sets are fictitious constructions unless otherwise indicated. Despite the fiction, they are deliberately designed to present the reader with something resembling how the data might look in practice, albeit cleaner and more organized.\nThe chapters of this book are arranged as follows:\n\nChapter 2 covers the basics of the R programming language for those who want to attempt to jump straight in to the work in subsequent chapters but have very little R experience. Experienced R programmers can skip this chapter.\nChapter 3 covers the essential statistical concepts needed to understand multivariable regression models. It also serves as a tutorial in univariate and bivariate statistics illustrated with real data. If you need help developing a decent understanding of descriptive statistics, random distribution and hypothesis testing, this is an important chapter to study.\nChapter 4 covers linear regression and in the course of that introduces many other foundational concepts. The walkthrough example involves modeling academic results from prior results. The exercises involve modeling income levels based on various work and demographic factors.\nChapter 5 covers binomial logistic regression. The walkthrough example involves modeling promotion likelihood based on performance metrics. The exercises involve modeling charitable donation likelihood based on prior donation behavior and demographics.\nChapter 6 covers multinomial regression. The walkthrough example and exercise involves modeling the choice of three health insurance products by company employees based on demographic and position data.\nChapter 7 covers ordinal regression. The walkthrough example involves modeling in-game disciplinary action against soccer players based on prior discipline and other factors. The exercises involve modeling manager performance based on varied data.\nChapter 8 covers count data regression, including Poisson, Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. The walkthrough example involves modeling absenteeism in a technology company. The exercises involve modeling the number of complaints received about telephone customer service representatives in a retail company.\nChapter 9 covers modeling options for data with explicit or latent hierarchy. The first part covers mixed modeling and uses a model of speed dating decisions as a walkthrough and example. The second part covers structural equation modeling and uses a survey for a political party as a walkthrough example. The exercises involve modeling latent variables in an employee engagement survey.\nChapter 10 covers survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression and frailty models. The chapter uses employee attrition as a walkthrough example and exercise.\nChapter 11 covers power analysis, focusing in particular on estimating the required minimum sample sizes in establishing meaningful inferences for both simple statistical tests and multivariate models. Examples related to experimental studies are used to illustrate, such as concurrent validity studies of selection instruments.\n\nChapter 12 is a set of problems and data sets which will allow the reader to practice the skills they have learned in this book and apply them to a variety of people analytics domains such as recruiting, performance, promotion, compensation and learning. Sets of discussion questions and data exercises will guide the reader through each problem, but these are designed in a way that encourages the independent selection and application of the methods covered in this book. These data sets, problems and exercises would suit as homework material for classes in statistical modeling or people analytics.",

    "text": "2.1 What is R?\nMost of the work in this book is implemented in the R statistical programming language which, along with Python, is one of the two languages that I use in my day-to-day statistical analysis. Sample implementations in Python are also provided at the end of the relevant chapters or sections. I have made efforts to keep the code as simple as possible, and I have tried to avoid the use of too many external packages. For the most part, readers should see (especially in the earlier chapters) that code blocks are short and simple, relying wherever possible on base R functionality. No doubt there are neater and more effective ways to code some of the material in this book using a wide array of R packages, but my priority has been to keep the code simple, consistent and easily reproducible.\nFor those who wish to follow the method and theory without the implementations in this book, there is no need to read this chapter. However, the style of this book is to use implementation to illustrate theory and practice, and so tolerance of many code blocks will be necessary as you read onward.\nFor those who wish to simply replicate the models as quickly as possible, they will be able to avail of the code block copying feature, which appears whenever you scroll over an input code block. Assuming all the required external packages have been installed, these code blocks should all be transportable and immediately usable. For those who are extra-inquisitive and want to explore how I constructed graphics used for illustration (for which code is usually not displayed), the best place to go is the Github repository for this book.\nThis chapter is for those who wish to learn the methods in this book but do not know how to use R. However, it is not intended to be a full tutorial on R. There are many more qualified individuals and existing resources that would better serve that purpose—in particular I recommend Wickham, Grolemund, and Çetinkaya-Rundel (2023). It is recommended that you consult these resources and become comfortable with the basics of R before proceeding into the later chapters of this book. However, acknowledging that many will want to dive in sooner rather than later, this chapter covers the absolute basics of R that will allow the uninitiated reader to proceed with at least some orientation.\nR is a programming language that was originally developed by and for statisticians, but in recent years its capabilities and the environments in which it is used have expanded greatly, with extensive use nowadays in academia and the public and private sectors. There are many advantages to using a programming language like R. Here are some:\nThere is often heated debate about which tools are better for doing non-trivial statistical analysis. I personally find that R provides the widest array of resources for those interested in inferential modeling, while Python has a more well-developed toolkit for predictive modeling and machine learning. Since the primary focus of this book is inferential modeling, the in-depth walkthroughs are coded in R.",

    "text": "2.2 How to start using R\nJust like most programming languages, R itself is an interpreter which receives input and returns output. It is not very easy to use without an IDE. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which is a convenient user interface allowing an R programmer to do all their main tasks including writing and running R code, saving files, viewing data and plots, integrating code into documents and many other things. By far the most popular IDE for R is RStudio. An example of what the RStudio IDE looks like can be seen in Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The RStudio IDE\n\n\n\nTo start using R, follow these steps:\n\nDownload and install the latest version of R from https://www.r-project.org/. Ensure that the version suits your operating system.\nDownload the latest version of the RStudio Desktop IDE from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Consult the user guide at https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ to help orient yourself to the features of RStudio.\n\nOpen RStudio and play around.\n\nThe initial stages of using R can be challenging, mostly due to the need to become familiar with how R understands, stores and processes data. Extensive trial and error is a learning necessity. Perseverance is important in these early stages, as well as an openness to seek help from others either in person or via online forums. Try not to rely too much on Generative AI tools for help, as they can often lead to you missing important learning steps, and they can also generate error-prone code.",

    "section": "2.3 Data in R",
    "text": "2.3 Data in R\nAs you start to do tasks involving data in R, you will generally want to store the things you create so that you can refer to them later. Simply calculating something does not store it in R. For example, a simple calculation like this can be performed easily:\n\n3 + 3\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nHowever, as soon as the calculation is complete, it is forgotten by R because the result hasn’t been assigned anywhere. To store something in your R session, you will assign it a name using the &lt;- operator. So I can assign my previous calculation to an object called my_sum, and this allows me to access the value at any time.\n\n# store the result\nmy_sum &lt;- 3 + 3\n\n# now I can work with it\nmy_sum + 3\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nYou will see above that you can comment your code by simply adding a # to the start of a line to ensure that the line is ignored by the interpreter.\nNote that assignment to an object does not result in the value being displayed. To display the value, the name of the object must be typed, the print() command used or the command should be wrapped in parentheses.\n\n# show me the value of my_sum\nmy_sum\n\n[1] 6\n\n# assign my_sum + 3 to new_sum and show its value\n(new_sum &lt;- my_sum + 3)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Data types\nAll data in R has an associated type, to reflect the wide range of data that R is able to work with. The typeof() function can be used to see the type of a single scalar value. Let’s look at the most common scalar data types.\nNumeric data can be in integer form or double (decimal) form.\n\n# integers can be signified by adding an 'L' to the end\nmy_integer &lt;- 1L  \nmy_double &lt;- 6.38\n\ntypeof(my_integer)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\ntypeof(my_double)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nCharacter data is text data surrounded by single or double quotes.\n\nmy_character &lt;- \"THIS IS TEXT\"\ntypeof(my_character)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nLogical data takes the form TRUE or FALSE.\n\nmy_logical &lt;- TRUE\ntypeof(my_logical)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Homogeneous data structures\nVectors are one-dimensional structures containing data of the same type and are notated by using c(). The type of the vector can also be viewed using the typeof() function, but the str() function can be used to display both the contents of the vector and its type.\n\nmy_double_vector &lt;- c(2.3, 6.8, 4.5, 65, 6)\nstr(my_double_vector)\n\n num [1:5] 2.3 6.8 4.5 65 6\n\n\nCategorical data—which takes only a finite number of possible values—can be stored as a factor vector to make it easier to perform grouping and manipulation.\n\ncategories &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"C\")\n)\n\nstr(categories)\n\n Factor w/ 3 levels \"A\",\"B\",\"C\": 1 2 3 1 3\n\n\nIf needed, the factors can be given order.\n\n# character vector \nranking &lt;- c(\"Medium\", \"High\", \"Low\")\nstr(ranking)\n\n chr [1:3] \"Medium\" \"High\" \"Low\"\n\n# turn it into an ordered factor\nranking_factors &lt;- ordered(\n  ranking, levels = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")\n)\n\nstr(ranking_factors)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"Low\"&lt;\"Medium\"&lt;..: 2 3 1\n\n\nThe number of elements in a vector can be seen using the length() function.\n\nlength(categories)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nSimple numeric sequence vectors can be created using shorthand notation.\n\n(my_sequence &lt;- 1:10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIf you try to mix data types inside a vector, it will usually result in type coercion, where one or more of the types are forced into a different type to ensure homogeneity. Often this means the vector will become a character vector.\n\n# numeric sequence vector\nvec &lt;- 1:5\nstr(vec)\n\n int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n# create a new vector containing vec and the character \"hello\"\nnew_vec &lt;- c(vec, \"hello\")\n\n# numeric values have been coerced into their character equivalents\nstr(new_vec)\n\n chr [1:6] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"hello\"\n\n\nBut sometimes logical or factor types will be coerced to numeric.\n\n# attempt a mixed logical and numeric\nmix &lt;- c(TRUE, 6)\n\n# logical has been converted to binary numeric (TRUE = 1)\nstr(mix)\n\n num [1:2] 1 6\n\n# try to add a numeric to our previous categories factor vector\nnew_categories &lt;- c(categories, 1)\n\n# categories have been coerced to background integer representations\nstr(new_categories)\n\n num [1:6] 1 2 3 1 3 1\n\n\nMatrices are two-dimensional data structures of the same type and are built from a vector by defining the number of rows and columns. Data is read into the matrix down the columns, starting left and moving right. Matrices are rarely used for non-numeric data types.\n\n# create a 2x2 matrix with the first four integers\n(m &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nArrays are n-dimensional data structures with the same data type and are not used extensively by most R users.\n\n\n2.3.3 Heterogeneous data structures\nLists are one-dimensional data structures that can take data of any type.\n\nmy_list &lt;- list(6, TRUE, \"hello\")\nstr(my_list)\n\nList of 3\n $ : num 6\n $ : logi TRUE\n $ : chr \"hello\"\n\n\nList elements can be any data type and any dimension. Each element can be given a name.\n\nnew_list &lt;- list(\n  scalar = 6, \n  vector = c(\"Hello\", \"Goodbye\"), \n  matrix = matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n)\n\nstr(new_list)\n\nList of 3\n $ scalar: num 6\n $ vector: chr [1:2] \"Hello\" \"Goodbye\"\n $ matrix: int [1:2, 1:2] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nNamed list elements can be accessed by using $.\n\nnew_list$matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nDataframes are the most used data structure in R; they are effectively a named list of vectors of the same length, with each vector as a column. As such, a dataframe is very similar in nature to a typical database table or spreadsheet.\n\n# two vectors of different types but same length\nnames &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Ayesha\")\nages &lt;- c(31, 24)\n\n# create a dataframe\n(df &lt;- data.frame(names, ages))\n\n   names ages\n1   John   31\n2 Ayesha   24\n\n# get types of columns\nstr(df)\n\n'data.frame':   2 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ names: chr  \"John\" \"Ayesha\"\n $ ages : num  31 24\n\n# get dimensions of df\ndim(df)\n\n[1] 2 2",

    "section": "2.4 Working with dataframes",
    "text": "2.4 Working with dataframes\nThe dataframe is the most common data structure used by analysts in R, due to its similarity to data tables found in databases and spreadsheets. We will work almost entirely with dataframes in this book, so let’s get to know them.\n\n2.4.1 Loading and tidying data in dataframes\nTo work with data in R, you usually need to pull it in from an outside source into a dataframe1. R facilitates numerous ways of importing data from simple .csv files, from Excel files, from online sources or from databases. Let’s load a data set that we will use later—the salespeople data set, which contains some information on the sales, average customer ratings and performance ratings of salespeople. The read.csv() function can accept a URL address of the file if it is online.\n\n# url of data set \nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv\"\n\n# load the data set and store it as a dataframe called salespeople\nsalespeople &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\nWe might not want to display this entire data set before knowing how big it is. We can view the dimensions, and if it is too big to display, we can use the head() function to display just the first few rows.\n\ndim(salespeople)\n\n[1] 351   4\n\n# hundreds of rows, so view first few\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nWe can view a specific column by using $, and we can use square brackets to view a specific entry. For example if we wanted to see the 6th entry of the sales column:\n\nsalespeople$sales[6]\n\n[1] 918\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use a [row, column] index to get a specific entry in the dataframe.\n\nsalespeople[34, 4]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can take a look at the data types using str().\n\nstr(salespeople)\n\n'data.frame':   351 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ promoted     : int  0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ sales        : int  594 446 674 525 657 918 318 364 342 387 ...\n $ customer_rate: num  3.94 4.06 3.83 3.62 4.4 4.54 3.09 4.89 3.74 3 ...\n $ performance  : int  2 3 4 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 ...\n\n\nWe can also see a statistical summary of each column using summary(), which tells us various statistics depending on the type of the column.\n\nsummary(salespeople)\n\n    promoted          sales       customer_rate    performance \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :151.0   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:389.2   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :0.0000   Median :475.0   Median :3.620   Median :3.0  \n Mean   :0.3219   Mean   :527.0   Mean   :3.608   Mean   :2.5  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:667.2   3rd Qu.:4.290   3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :945.0   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :4.0  \n                  NA's   :1       NA's   :1       NA's   :1    \n\n\nNote that there is missing data in this dataframe, indicated by NAs in the summary. Missing data is identified by a special NA value in R. This should not be confused with \"NA\", which is simply a character string. The function is.na() will look at all values in a vector or dataframe and return TRUE or FALSE based on whether they are NA or not. By adding these up using the sum() function, it will take TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, which effectively provides a count of missing data.\n\nsum(is.na(salespeople))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThis is a small number of NAs given the dimensions of our data set and we might want to remove the rows of data that contain NAs. The easiest way is to use the complete.cases() function, which identifies the rows that have no NAs, and then we can select those rows from the dataframe based on that condition. Note that you can overwrite objects with the same name in R.\n\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# confirm no NAs\nsum(is.na(salespeople))\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nWe can see the unique values of a vector or column using the unique() function.\n\nunique(salespeople$performance)\n\n[1] 2 3 4 1\n\n\nIf we need to change the type of a column in a dataframe, we can use the as.numeric(), as.character(), as.logical() or as.factor() functions. For example, given that there are only four unique values for the performance column, we may want to convert it to a factor.\n\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$performance)\nstr(salespeople)\n\n'data.frame':   350 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ promoted     : int  0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ sales        : int  594 446 674 525 657 918 318 364 342 387 ...\n $ customer_rate: num  3.94 4.06 3.83 3.62 4.4 4.54 3.09 4.89 3.74 3 ...\n $ performance  : Factor w/ 4 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\": 2 3 4 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 ...\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Manipulating dataframes\nDataframes can be subsetted to contain only rows that satisfy specific conditions.\n\n(sales_720 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales == 720))\n\n    promoted sales customer_rate performance\n290        1   720          3.76           3\n\n\nNote the use of ==, which is used in many programming languages, to test for precise equality. Similarly we can select columns based on inequalities (&gt; for ‘greater than’‍, &lt; for ‘less than’‍, &gt;= for ‘greater than or equal to’‍, &lt;= for ‘less than or equal to’‍, or != for ‘not equal to’). For example:\n\nhigh_sales &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales &gt;= 700)\nhead(high_sales)\n\n   promoted sales customer_rate performance\n6         1   918          4.54           2\n12        1   716          3.16           3\n20        1   937          5.00           2\n21        1   702          3.53           4\n25        1   819          4.45           2\n26        1   736          3.94           4\n\n\nTo select specific columns use the select argument.\n\nsalespeople_sales_perf &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                                 select = c(\"sales\", \"performance\"))\nhead(salespeople_sales_perf)\n\n  sales performance\n1   594           2\n2   446           3\n3   674           4\n4   525           2\n5   657           3\n6   918           2\n\n\nTwo dataframes with the same column names can be combined by their rows.\n\nlow_sales &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales &lt; 400)\n\n# bind the rows of low_sales and high_sales together\nlow_and_high_sales = rbind(low_sales, high_sales)\nhead(low_and_high_sales)\n\n   promoted sales customer_rate performance\n7         0   318          3.09           3\n8         0   364          4.89           1\n9         0   342          3.74           3\n10        0   387          3.00           3\n15        0   344          3.02           2\n16        0   372          3.87           3\n\n\nTwo dataframes with different column names can be combined by their columns.\n\n# two dataframes with two columns each\nsales_perf &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                     select = c(\"sales\", \"performance\"))\nprom_custrate &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                        select = c(\"promoted\", \"customer_rate\"))\n\n# bind the columns to create a dataframe with four columns\nfull_df &lt;- cbind(sales_perf, prom_custrate)\nhead(full_df)\n\n  sales performance promoted customer_rate\n1   594           2        0          3.94\n2   446           3        0          4.06\n3   674           4        1          3.83\n4   525           2        0          3.62\n5   657           3        1          4.40\n6   918           2        1          4.54",

    "section": "2.5 Functions, packages and libraries",
    "text": "2.5 Functions, packages and libraries\nIn the code so far we have used a variety of functions. For example head(), subset(), rbind(). Functions are operations that take certain defined inputs and return an output. Functions exist to perform common useful operations.\n\n2.5.1 Using functions\nFunctions usually take one or more arguments. Often there are a large number of arguments that a function can take, but many are optional and not required to be specified by the user. For example, the function head(), which displays the first rows of a dataframe2, has only one required argument x: the name of the dataframe. A second argument is optional, n: the number of rows to display. If n is not entered, it is assumed to have the default value n = 6.\nWhen running a function, you can either specify the arguments by name or you can enter them in order without their names. If you enter arguments without naming them, R expects the arguments to be entered in exactly the right order.\n\n# see the head of salespeople, with the default of six rows\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\n\n# see fewer rows - arguments need to be in the right order if not named\nhead(salespeople, 3)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n\n\n\n# or if you don't know the right order, \n# name your arguments and you can put them in any order\nhead(n = 3, x = salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Help with functions\nMost functions in R have excellent help documentation. To get help on the head() function, type help(head) or ?head. This will display the results in the Help browser window in RStudio. Alternatively you can open the Help browser window directly in RStudio and do a search there. An example of the browser results for head() is in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Results of a search for the head() function in the RStudio Help browser\n\n\n\nThe help page normally shows the following:\n\nDescription of the purpose of the function\nUsage examples, so you can quickly see how it is used\nArguments list so you can see the names and order of arguments\nDetails or notes on further considerations on use\nExpected value of the output (for example head() is expected to return a similar object to its first input x)\nExamples to help orient you further (sometimes examples can be very abstract in nature and not so helpful to users)\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Writing your own functions\nFunctions are not limited to those that come packaged in R. Users can write their own functions to perform tasks that are helpful to their objectives. Experienced programmers in most languages subscribe to a principle called DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Whenever a task needs to be done repeatedly, it is poor practice to write the same code numerous times. It makes more sense to write a function to do the task.\nIn this example, a simple function is written which generates a report on a dataframe:\n\n# create df_report function\ndf_report &lt;- function(df) {\n  paste(\"This dataframe contains\", nrow(df), \"rows and\", \n        ncol(df), \"columns. There are\", sum(is.na(df)), \"NA entries.\")\n}\n\nWe can test our function by using the built-in mtcars data set in R.\n\ndf_report(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"This dataframe contains 32 rows and 11 columns. There are 0 NA entries.\"\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Installing packages\nAll the common functions that we have used so far exist in the base R installation. However, the beauty of open source languages like R is that users can write their own functions or resources and release them to others via packages. A package is an additional module that can be installed easily; it makes resources available which are not in the base R installation. In this book we will be using functions from both base R and from popular and useful packages. As an example, a popular package used for statistical modeling is the MASS package, which is based on methods in a popular applied statistics book3.\nBefore an external package can be used, it must be installed into your package library using install.packages(). So to install MASS, type install.packages(\"MASS\") into the console. This will send R to the main internet repository for R packages (known as CRAN). It will find the right version of MASS for your operating system and download and install it into your package library. If MASS needs other packages in order to work, it will also install these packages.\nIf you want to install more than one package, put the names of the packages inside a character vector—for example:\n\nmy_packages &lt;- c(\"MASS\", \"DescTools\", \"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(my_packages)\n\nOnce you have installed a package, you can see what functions are available by calling for help on it, for example using help(package = MASS). One package you may wish to install now is the peopleanalyticsdata package, which contains all the data sets used in this book. By installing and loading this package, all the data sets used in this book will be loaded into your R session and ready to work with. If you do this, you can ignore the read.csv() commands later in the book, which download the data from the internet.\n\n\n2.5.5 Using packages\nOnce you have installed a package into your package library, to use it in your R session you need to load it using the library() function. For example, to load MASS after installing it, use library(MASS). Often nothing will happen when you use this command, but rest assured the package has been loaded and you can start to use the functions inside it. Sometimes when you load the package a series of messages will display, usually to make you aware of certain things that you need to keep in mind when using the package. Note that whenever you see the library() command in this book, it is assumed that you have already installed the package in that command. If you have not, the library() command will fail.\nOnce a package is loaded from your library, you can use any of the functions inside it. For example, the stepAIC() function is not available before you load the MASS package but becomes available after it is loaded. In this sense, functions ‘belong’ to packages.\nProblems can occur when you load packages that contain functions with the same name as functions that already exist in your R session. Often the messages you see when loading a package will alert you to this. When R is faced with a situation where a function exists in multiple packages you have loaded, R always defaults to the function in the most recently loaded package. This may not always be what you intended.\nOne way to completely avoid this issue is to get in the habit of namespacing your functions. To namespace, you simply use package::function(), so to safely call stepAIC() from MASS, you use MASS::stepAIC(). Most of the time in this book when a function is being called from a package outside base R, I use namespacing to call that function. This should help avoid confusion about which packages are being used for which functions.\n\n\n2.5.6 The pipe operator\nEven in the most elementary briefing about R, it is very difficult to ignore the pipe operator. The pipe operator makes code more natural to read and write and reduces the typical computing problem of many nested operations inside parentheses.\nAs an example, imagine we wanted to do the following two operations in one command:\n\nSubset salespeople to only the sales values of those with sales less than 500\nTake the mean of those values\n\nIn base R, one way to do this is:\n\nmean(subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500))\n\n[1] 388.6684\n\n\nThis is nested and needs to be read from the inside out in order to align with the instructions. The pipe operator |&gt; takes the command that comes before it and places it inside the function that follows it (by default as the first argument). This reduces complexity and allows you to follow the logic more clearly.\n\n# use the pipe operator to lay out the steps more logically\nsubset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500) |&gt; \n  mean() \n\n[1] 388.6684\n\n\nThis can be extended to perform arbitrarily many operations in one piped command.\n\nsalespeople$sales |&gt; # start with all data\n  subset(subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500) |&gt; # get the subsetted data\n  mean() |&gt; # take the mean value\n  round() # round to the nearest integer\n\n[1] 389\n\n\nThe pipe operator is unique to R and is very widely used because it helps to make code more readable, it reduces complexity, and it helps orient around a common ‘grammar’ for the manipulation of data. The pipe operator helps you structure your code more clearly around nouns (objects), verbs (functions) and adverbs (arguments of functions). One of the most developed sets of packages in R that follows these principles is the tidyverse family of packages, which I encourage you to explore.",

    "text": "2.6 Errors, warnings and messages\nAs I mentioned earlier in this chapter, getting familiar with R can be frustrating at the beginning if you have never programmed before. You can expect to regularly see messages, warnings or errors in response to your commands. I encourage you to regard these as your friend rather than your enemy. It is very tempting to take the latter approach when you are starting out, but over time I hope you will appreciate some wisdom from my words.\nErrors are serious problems which usually result in the halting of your code and a failure to return your requested output. They usually come with an indication of the source of the error, and these can sometimes be easy to understand and sometimes frustratingly vague and abstract. For example, an easy-to-understand error is:\n\nsubset(salespeople, subset = sales = 720)\n\nError: unexpected '=' in \"subset(salespeople, subset = sales =\"\nThis helps you see that you have used sales = 720 as a condition to subset your data, when you should have used sales == 720 for precise equality.\nA much more challenging error to understand is:\n\nhead[salespeople]\n\nError in head[salespeople] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\nWhen first faced with an error that you can’t understand, try not to get frustrated and proceed in the knowledge that it usually can be fixed easily and quickly. Often the problem is much more obvious than you think, and if not, there is still a 99% likelihood that others have made this error and you can read about it online. The first step is to take a look at your code to see if you can spot what you did wrong. In this case, you may see that you have used square brackets [] instead of parentheses () when calling your head() function. If you cannot see what is wrong, the next steps are to ask a colleague, do an internet search with the text of the error message you receive, ask a Generative AI coding assistant or consult online forums like https://stackoverflow.com. The more experienced you become, the easier it is to interpret error messages.\nWarnings are less serious and usually alert you to something that you might be overlooking and which could indicate a problem with the output. In many cases you can ignore warnings, but sometimes they are an important reminder to go back and edit your code. For example, you may run a model which doesn’t converge, and while this does not stop R from returning results, it is also very useful for you to know that it didn’t converge.\nMessages are pieces of information that may or may not be useful to you at a particular point in time. Sometimes you will receive messages when you load a package from your library. Sometimes messages will keep you up to date on the progress of a process that is taking a long time to execute.",

    "section": "2.7 Plotting and graphing",
    "text": "2.7 Plotting and graphing\nAs you might expect in a well-developed programming language, there are numerous ways to plot and graph information in R. If you are doing exploratory data analysis on fairly simple data and you don’t need to worry about pretty appearance or formatting, the built-in plot capabilities of base R are fine. If you need a pretty appearance, more precision, color coding or even 3D graphics or animation, there are also specialized plotting and graphing packages for these purposes. In general when working interactively in RStudio, graphical output will be rendered in the Plots pane, where you can copy it or save it as an image.\n\n2.7.1 Plotting in base R\nThe simplest plot function in base R is plot(). This performs basic X-Y plotting. As an example, this code will generate a scatter plot of customer_rate against sales in the salespeople data set, with the results displayed in Figure 2.3. Note the use of the arguments main, xlab and ylab for customizing the axis labels and title for the plot.\n\n\n\n\n# scatter plot of customer_rate against sales\nplot(x = salespeople$sales, y = salespeople$customer_rate,\n     xlab = \"Sales ($m)\", ylab = \"Average customer rating\",\n     main = \"Scatterplot of Sales vs Customer Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Simple scatterplot of customer_rate against sales in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nHistograms of data can be generated using the hist() function. This command will generate a histogram of performance as displayed in Figure 2.4. Note the use of breaks to customize how the bars appear.\n\n\n\n\n# convert performance ratings back to numeric data type for histogram\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.numeric(salespeople$performance)\n\n# histogram of performance ratings\nhist(salespeople$performance, breaks = 0:4,\n     xlab = \"Performance Rating\", \n     main = \"Histogram of Performance Ratings\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Simple histogram of performance in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nBox and whisker plots are excellent ways to see the distribution of a variable, and can be grouped against another variable to see bivariate patterns. For example, this command will show a box and whisker plot of sales grouped against performance, with the output shown in Figure 2.5. Note the use of the formula and data notation here to define the variable we are interested in and how we want it grouped. We will study this formula notation in greater depth later in this book.\n\n\n\n\n# box plot of sales by performance rating\nboxplot(formula = sales ~ performance, data = salespeople,\n        xlab = \"Performance Rating\", ylab = \"Sales ($m)\",\n        main = \"Boxplot of Sales by Performance Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Simple box plot of sales grouped against performance in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nThese are among the most common plots used for data exploration purposes. They are examples of a wider range of plotting and graphing functions available in base R, such as line plots, bar plots and other varieties which you may see later in this book.\n\n\n2.7.2 Specialist plotting and graphing packages\nBy far the most commonly used specialist plotting and graphing package in R is ggplot2. ggplot2 allows the flexible construction of a very wide range of charts and graphs, but uses a very specific command grammar which can take some getting used to. However, once learned, ggplot2 can be an extremely powerful tool. Many of the illustratory figures used in this book are developed using ggplot2 and while the code for these figures is generally not included for the sake of brevity, you can always find it in the source code of this book on Github4. A great learning resource for ggplot2 is Wickham, Navarro, and Pedersen (2023).\nThe plotly package allows the use of the plotly graphing library in R. This is an excellent package for interactive graphing and is used for 3D illustrations in this book. Output can be rendered in HTML—allowing the user to play with and explore the graphs interactively—or can be saved as static 2D images.\nGGally is a package that extends ggplot2 to allow easy combination of charts and graphs. This is particularly valuable for quicker exploratory data analysis. One of its most popular functions is ggpairs(), which produces a pairplot. A pairplot is a visualization of all univariate and bivariate patterns in a data set, with univariate distributions in the diagonal and bivariate relationships or correlations displayed in the off-diagonal. Figure 2.6 is an example of a pairplot for the salespeople data set, which we will explore further in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# convert performance and promotion to categorical\nsalespeople$promoted &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$promoted)\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$performance)\n\n# pairplot of salespeople\nGGally::ggpairs(salespeople)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Pairplot of the salespeople data set",

    "text": "2.8 Documenting your work using Quarto\nFor anyone performing any sort of multivariable analysis using a statistical programming language, appropriate documentation and reproducibility of the work is essential to its success and longevity. If your code is not easily obtained or run by others, it is likely to have a very limited impact and lifetime. Learning how to create integrated documents that contain both text and code is critical to providing access to your code and narration of your work.\nQuarto is a package which allows you to create integrated documents containing both formatted text and executed code. It is, in my opinion, one of the best resources available currently for this purpose. This entire book has been created using Quarto. You can start a Quarto document in RStudio by installing the by opening a new Quarto document file, which will have the suffix .qmd.\nQuarto documents always start with a particular heading type called a YAML header, which contains overall information on the document you are creating. Care must be taken with the precise formatting of the YAML header, as it is sensitive to spacing and indentation. Usually a basic YAML header is created for you in RStudio when you start a new .qmd file. Here is an example.\n---\ntitle: \"My new document\"\nauthor: \"Keith McNulty\"\ndate: 2025-11-10\nformat: html\n---\nThe format part of this header has numerous options, but the most commonly used are html, which generates your document as a web page, and pdf, which generates your document as a PDF using the open source LaTeX software package. If you wish to create PDF documents you will need to have a version of LaTeX installed on your system. Running the system command quarto install tinytex will install a minimal version of LaTeX which is fine for most purposes.\nQuarto allows you to build a formatted document using many shorthand formatting commands. Here are a few examples of how to format headings and place web links or images in your document:\n# My top heading\n\nThis section is about this general topic.\n\n## My first sub heading \n\nTo see more information on this sub-topic visit [here](https://my.web.link).\n\n## My second sub heading\n\nHere is a nice picture about this sub-topic.\n\n![](path/to/image)\nCode can be written and executed and the results displayed inline using backticks. For example, writing\n`{r} nrow(salespeople)`\ninline will display 351 in the final document. Entire code blocks can be included and executed by using triple-backticks. The following code block:\n```{r}\n# show the first few rows of salespeople\nhead(salespeople)\n```\nwill display this output:\n\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nThe {} wrapping allows you to specify different languages for your code chunk. For example, if you wanted to run Python code instead of R code you can use {python}.\nYou can set options for your code chunks inside a code block by starting your line with #|. For example, if you want the results of your code to be displayed, but without the code itself being displayed, you can start your code block with the line #| echo: false.\nThe process of compiling your Quarto code to produce a document is known as ‘rendering’. To create a rendered document, you simply need to click on the ‘Render’ button in RStudio that appears above your Quarto code.\nIf you are not familiar with Quarto, I strongly encourage you to learn it alongside R and to challenge yourself to write up any practice exercises you take on in this book using Quarto. You can find a really helpful and thorough user guide for Quarto at https://quarto.org/.",

Many of the assumptions and results of multivariable models require an understanding of these foundations in order to be properly interpreted. There are three topics that are particularly important for those proceeding further in this book:\nIf you have never really studied these topics, I would strongly recommend taking a course in them and spending good time getting to know them. Again, just as the last chapter was not intended to be a comprehensive tutorial on R, neither is this chapter intended to be a comprehensive tutorial on introductory statistics. However, we will introduce some key concepts here that are critical to understanding later chapters, and as always we will illustrate using real data examples.\nIn preparation for this chapter we are going to download a data set that we will work through in a later chapter, and use it for practical examples and illustration purposes. The data are a set of information on the sales, customer ratings and performance ratings on a set of 351 salespeople as well as an indication of whether or not they were promoted.\nLet’s take a brief look at the first few rows of this data to make sure we know what is inside it.\nAnd let’s understand the structure of this data.\nIt looks like:\nAny collection of numerical data on one or more variables can be described using a number of common statistical concepts.

    "text": "3.1.1 Mean, variance and standard deviation\nThe mean is the average value of the observations and is defined by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) of our sample \\(x\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i\n\\] While the mean of a sample \\(x\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\), the mean of an entire population is usually denoted by \\(\\mu\\). The mean can have a different interpretation depending on the type of data being studied. Let’s look at the mean of three different columns of our salespeople data, making sure to ignore any missing data.\n\nmean(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 527.0057\n\n\nThis looks very intuitive and appears to be the average amount of sales made by the individuals in the data set.\n\nmean(salespeople$promoted, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.3219373\n\n\nGiven that this data can only have the value of 0 or 1, we interpret this mean as the likelihood or expectation that an individual will be labeled as 1. That is, the average probability of promotion in the data set. If this data showed a perfectly random likelihood of promotion, we would expect this to take the value of 0.5. But it is lower than 0.5, which tells us that the majority of individuals are not promoted.\n\nmean(salespeople$performance, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nGiven that this data can only have the values 1, 2, 3 or 4, we interpret this as the expected value of the performance rating in the data set. Higher or lower means inform us about the distribution of the performance ratings. A low mean will indicate a skew towards a low rating, and a high mean will indicate a skew towards a high rating.\nOther common statistical summary measures include the median, which is the middle value when the values are ranked in order, and the mode, which is the most frequently occurring value.\nThe variance is a measure of how much the data varies around its mean. There are two different definitions of variance. The population variance assumes that that we are working with the entire population and is defined as the average squared difference from the mean:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_p(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\] The sample variance assumes that we are working with a sample and attempts to estimate the variance of a larger population by applying Bessel’s correction to account for potential sampling error. The sample variance is:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_s(x) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\]\nYou can see that\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_p(x) = \\frac{n - 1}{n}\\mathrm{Var}_s(x)\n\\] So as the data set gets larger, the sample variance and the population variance become less and less distinguishable, which intuitively makes sense.\nBecause we rarely work with full populations, the sample variance is calculated by default in R and in many other statistical software packages.\n\n# sample variance \n(sample_variance_sales &lt;- var(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n[1] 34308.11\n\n\nSo where necessary, we need to apply a transformation to get the population variance.\n\n# population variance (need length of non-NA data)\nn &lt;- length(na.omit(salespeople$sales))\n(population_variance_sales &lt;- ((n-1)/n) * sample_variance_sales)\n\n[1] 34210.09\n\n\nVariance does not have intuitive scale relative to the data being studied, because we have used a ‘squared distance metric’‍, therefore we can square-root it to get a measure of ‘deviance’ on the same scale as the data. We call this the standard deviation \\(\\sigma(x)\\), where \\(\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\sigma(x)^2\\). As with variance, standard deviation has both population and sample versions, and the sample version is calculated by default. Conversion between the two takes the form\n\\[\n\\sigma_p(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{n-1}{n}}\\sigma_s(x)\n\\]\n\n# sample standard deviation\n(sample_sd_sales &lt;- sd(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n[1] 185.2245\n\n# verify that sample sd is sqrt(sample var)\nsample_sd_sales == sqrt(sample_variance_sales)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# calculate population standard deviation\n(population_sd_sales &lt;- sqrt((n-1)/n) * sample_sd_sales)\n\n[1] 184.9597\n\n\nGiven the range of sales is [151, 945] and the mean is 527, we see that the standard deviation gives a more intuitive sense of the ‘spread’ of the data relative to its inherent scale.\n\n\n3.1.2 Covariance and correlation\nThe covariance between two variables is a measure of the extent to which one changes as the other changes. If \\(y = y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\) is a second variable, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\) are the means of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, then the sample covariance of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{cov}_s(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\n\\] and as with variance, the population covariance is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{cov}_p(x, y) = \\frac{n-1}{n}\\mathrm{cov}_s(x, y)\n\\]\nAgain, the sample covariance is the default in R, and we need to transform to obtain the population covariance.\n\n# get sample covariance for sales and customer_rate, \n# ignoring observations with missing data\n(sample_cov &lt;- cov(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate, \n                   use = \"complete.obs\"))\n\n[1] 55.81769\n\n# convert to population covariance (need number of complete obs)\ncols &lt;- subset(salespeople, select = c(\"sales\", \"customer_rate\"))\nn &lt;- nrow(cols[complete.cases(cols), ])\n(population_cov &lt;- ((n-1)/n) * sample_cov)\n\n[1] 55.65821\n\n\nAs can be seen, the difference in covariance is very small between the sample and population versions, and both confirm a positive relationship between sales and customer rating. However, we again see this issue that there is no intuitive sense of scale for this measure.\nPearson’s correlation coefficient divides the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables:\n\\[\nr_{x, y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x, y)}{\\sigma(x)\\sigma(y)}\n\\] This creates a scale of \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) for \\(r_{x, y}\\), which is an intuitive way of understanding both the direction and strength of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with \\(-1\\) indicating that \\(x\\) increases perfectly as \\(y\\) decreases, \\(1\\) indicating that \\(x\\) increases perfectly as \\(y\\) increases, and \\(0\\) indicating that there is no relationship between the two.\nAs before, there is a sample and population version of the correlation coefficient, and R calculates the sample version by default. Similar transformations can be used to determine a population correlation coefficient and over large samples the two measures converge.\n\n# calculate sample correlation between sales and customer_rate\ncor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.337805\n\n\nThis tells us that there is a moderate positive correlation between sales and customer rating.\nYou will notice that we have so far used two variables on a continuous scale to demonstrate covariance and correlation. Pearson’s correlation can also be used between a continuous scale and a dichotomous (binary) scale variable, and this is known as a point-biserial correlation.\n\ncor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$promoted, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.8511283\n\n\nCorrelating ranked variables involves an adjusted approach leading to Spearman’s rho (\\(\\rho\\)) or Kendall’s tau (\\(\\tau\\)), among others. We will not dive into the mathematics of this here, but a good source is Bhattacharya and Burman (2016). Spearman’s or Kendall’s variant should be used whenever at least one of the variables is a ranked variable, and both variants are available in R.\n\n# spearman's rho correlation\ncor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$performance, \n    method = \"spearman\", use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.2735446\n\n# kendall's tau correlation\ncor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$performance, \n    method = \"kendall\", use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.2073609\n\n\nIn this case, both indicate a low to moderate correlation. Spearman’s rho or Kendall’s tau can also be used to correlate a ranked and a dichotomous variable, and this is known as a rank-biserial correlation.",

    "section": "3.2 Distribution of random variables",
    "text": "3.2 Distribution of random variables\nAs we outlined in Section 1.2, when we build a model we are using a set of sample data to infer a general relationship on a larger population. A major underlying assumption in our inference is that we believe the real-life variables we are dealing with are random in nature. For example, we might be trying to model the drivers of the voting choice of millions of people in a national election, but we may only have sample data on a few thousand people. When we infer nationwide voting intentions from our sample, we assume that the characteristics of the voting population are random variables.\n\n3.2.1 Sampling of random variables\nWhen we describe variables as random, we are assuming that they take a form which is independent and identically distributed. Using our salespeople data as an example, we are assuming that the sales of one person in the data set is not influenced by the sales of another person in the data set. In this case, this seems like a reasonable assumption, and we will be making it for many (though not all) of the statistical methods used in this book. However, it is good to recognize that there are scenarios where this assumption cannot be made. For example, if the salespeople worked together in serving the same customers on the same products, and each individual’s sales represented some proportion of the overall sales to the customer, we cannot say that the sales data is independent and identically distributed. In this case, we will expect to see some hierarchy in our data and will need to adjust our techniques accordingly to take this into consideration.\nUnder the central limit theorem, if we take samples from a random variable and calculate a summary statistic for each sample, that statistic is itself a random variable, and its mean converges to the true population statistic with more and more sampling. Let’s test this with a little experiment on our salespeople data. Figure 3.1 shows the results of taking 10, 100 and 1000 different random samples of 50, 100 and 150 salespeople from the salespeople data set and creating a histogram of the resulting mean sales values. We can see how greater numbers of samples (down the rows) lead to a more normal distribution curve and larger sample sizes (across the columns) lead to a ‘spikier’ distribution with a smaller standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Histogram and density of mean sales from the salespeople data set based on sample sizes of 50, 100 and 150 (columns) and 10, 100 and 1000 samplings (rows)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Standard errors, the \\(t\\)-distribution and confidence intervals\nOne consequence of the observations in Figure 3.1 is that the summary statistics calculated from larger sample sizes fall into distributions that are ‘narrower’ and hence represent more precise estimations of the population statistic. The standard deviation of a sampled statistic is called the standard error of that statistic. In the special case of a sampled mean, the formula for the standard error of the mean can be derived to be\n\\[\nSE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the (sample) standard deviation and \\(n\\) is the sample size1. This confirms that the standard error of the mean decreases with greater sample size, confirming our intuition that the estimation of the mean is more precise with larger samples.\nTo apply this logic to our salespeople data set, let’s take a random sample of 100 values of customer_rate.\n\n# set seed for reproducibility of sampling\nset.seed(123)\n\n# generate a sample of 100 observations\ncustrate &lt;- na.omit(salespeople$customer_rate)\nn &lt;- 100\nsample_custrate &lt;- sample(custrate, n)\n\nWe can calculate the mean of the sample and the standard error of the mean.\n\n# mean\n(sample_mean &lt;- mean(sample_custrate))\n\n[1] 3.6485\n\n# standard error\n(se &lt;- sd(sample_custrate)/sqrt(n))\n\n[1] 0.08494328\n\n\nBecause the normal distribution is a frequency (or probability) distribution, we can interpret the standard error as a fundamental unit of ‘sensitivity’ around the sample mean. For greater multiples of standard errors around the sample mean, we can have greater certainty that the range contains the true population mean.\nTo calculate how many standard errors we would need around the sample mean to have a 95% probability of including the true population mean, we need to use the \\(t\\)-distribution. The \\(t\\)-distribution is essentially an approximation of the normal distribution acknowledging that we only have a sample estimate of the true population standard deviation in how we calculate the standard error. In this case where we are dealing with a single sample mean, we use the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. We can use the qt() function in R to find the standard error multiple associated with the level of certainty we need. In this case, we are looking for our true population mean to be outside the top 2.5% or bottom 2.5% of the distribution2.\n\n# get se multiple for 0.975\n(t &lt;- qt(p = 0.975, df = n - 1))\n\n[1] 1.984217\n\n\nWe see that approximately 1.98 standard errors on either side of our sample mean will give us 95% confidence that our range contains the true population mean. This is called the 95% confidence interval3.\n\n# 95% confidence interval lower and upper bounds\nlower_bound &lt;- sample_mean - t*se\nupper_bound &lt;- sample_mean + t*se\n\ncat(paste0('[', lower_bound, ', ', upper_bound, ']')) \n\n[3.47995410046738, 3.81704589953262]",

    "section": "3.3 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "3.3 Hypothesis testing\nObservations about the distribution of statistics on samples of random variables allow us to construct tests for hypotheses of difference or similarity. Such hypothesis testing is useful in itself for simple bivariate analysis in practice settings, but it will be particularly critical in later chapters in determining whether models are useful or not. Before we go through some technical examples of hypothesis testing, let’s overview the logic and intuition for how hypothesis testing works.\nThe purpose of hypothesis testing is to establish a high degree of statistical certainty regarding a claim of difference in a population based on the properties of a sample. Consistent with a high burden of proof, we start from the hypothesis that there is no difference, called the null hypothesis. We only reject the null hypothesis if the statistical properties of the sample data render it very unlikely, in which case we confirm the alternative hypothesis that a statistical difference does exist in the population.\nMost hypothesis tests can return a p-value, which is the maximum probability of finding the sample results (or results that are more extreme or unusual than the sample results) when the null hypothesis is true for the population. The analyst must decide on the level of p-value needed to reject the null hypothesis. This threshold is referred to as the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha). A common standard is to set \\(\\alpha\\) at 0.05. That is, we reject the null hypothesis if the p-value that we find for our sample results is less than 0.05. If we reject the null hypothesis at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), this means that the results we observe in the sample are so extreme or unusual that they would only occur by chance at most 1 in 20 times if the null hypothesis were true. An alpha of 0.05 is not the only standard of certainty used in research and practice, and in some fields of study smaller alphas are the norm, particularly if erroneous conclusions might have very serious consequences.\nThree of the most common types of hypothesis tests are4:\n\nTesting for a difference in the means of two groups\nTesting for a non-zero correlation between two variables\nTesting for a difference in frequency distributions between different categories\n\nWe will go through an example of each of these. In each case, you will see a three-step process. First, we calculate a test statistic. Second, we determine an expected distribution for that test statistic. Finally, we determine where our calculated statistic falls in that distribution in order to assess the likelihood of our sample occurring if the null hypothesis is true. During these examples, we will go through all the logic and calculation steps needed to do the hypothesis testing, before we demonstrate the simple functions that perform all the steps for you in R. Readers don’t absolutely need to know all the details contained in this section, but a strong understanding of the underlying methods is encouraged.\n\n3.3.1 Testing for a difference in means (Welch’s \\(t\\)-test)\nImagine that we are asked if, in general, the sales of low-performing salespeople are different from the sales of high-performing salespeople. This question refers to all salespeople, but we only have data for the sample in our salespeople data set. Let’s take two subsets of our data for those with a performance rating of 1 and those with a performance rating of 4, and calculate the difference in mean sales.\n\n# take two performance group samples \nperf1 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = performance == 1)\nperf4 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = performance == 4)\n\n# calculate the difference in mean sales\n(diff &lt;- mean(perf4$sales) - mean(perf1$sales))\n\n[1] 154.9742\n\n\nWe can see that those with a higher performance rating in our sample did generate higher mean sales than those with a lower performance rating. But these are just samples, and we are being asked to give a conclusion about the populations they are drawn from.\nLet’s take a null hypothesis that there is no difference in true mean sales between the two performance groups that these samples are drawn from. We combine the two samples and calculate the distribution around the difference in means. To reject the null hypothesis at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we would need to determine that the 95% confidence interval of this distribution does not contain zero.\nWe calculate the standard error of the combined sample using the formula5:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf1}}^2}{n_{\\mathrm{perf1}}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf4}}^2}{n_{\\mathrm{perf4}}}}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf1}}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf4}}\\) are the standard deviations of the two samples and \\(n_{\\mathrm{perf1}}\\) and \\(n_{\\mathrm{perf4}}\\) are the two sample sizes.\nWe use a special formula called the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation to calculate the degrees of freedom for the two samples, which in this case calculates to 100.986. This allows us to construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means, and we can test whether this contains zero.\n\n# calculate standard error of the two sets\nse &lt;- sqrt(sd(perf1$sales)^2/length(perf1$sales) \n           + sd(perf4$sales)^2/length(perf4$sales))\n\n# calculate the required t-statistic\nt &lt;- qt(p = 0.975, df = 100.98)\n\n# calculate 95% confidence interval\n(lower_bound &lt;- diff - t*se)\n\n[1] 88.56763\n\n(upper_bound &lt;- diff + t*se)\n\n[1] 221.3809\n\n# test if zero is inside this interval\n(0 &lt;= upper_bound) & (0 &gt;= lower_bound)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nSince this has returned FALSE, we conclude that a mean difference of zero is outside the 95% confidence interval of our sample mean difference, and so we cannot have 95% certainty that the difference in population means is zero. We reject the null hypothesis that the mean sales of both performance levels are the same.\nLooking at this graphically, we are assuming a \\(t\\)-distribution of the mean difference, and we are determining where zero sits in that distribution, as in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: \\(t\\)-distribution of the mean sales difference between perf1 and perf4, 95% confidence intervals (red dashed lines) and a zero difference (blue dot-dash line)\n\n\n\nThe red dashed lines in this diagram represent the 95% confidence interval around the mean difference of our two samples. The ‘tails’ of the curve outside of these two lines each represent a maximum of 0.025 probability for the true population mean. So we can see that the position of the blue dot-dashed line can correspond to a maximum probability that the population mean difference is zero. This is the p-value of the hypothesis test7.\nThe p-value can be derived by calculating the standard error multiple associated with zero in the \\(t\\)-distribution (called the \\(t\\)-statistic or \\(t\\)-value), by applying the conversion function pt() to obtain the upper tail probability and then multiplying by 2 to get the probability associated with both tails of the distribution.\n\n# get t-statistic\nt_actual &lt;- diff/se \n\n# convert t-statistic to p-value\n2*pt(t_actual, df = 100.98, lower = FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.093212e-05\n\n\nNowadays, it is never necessary to do these manual calculations ourselves because hypothesis tests are a standard part of statistical software. In R, the t.test() function performs a hypothesis test of difference in means of two samples and confirms our manually calculated p-value and 95% confidence interval.\n\nt.test(perf4$sales, perf1$sales)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  perf4$sales and perf1$sales\nt = 4.6295, df = 100.98, p-value = 1.093e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  88.5676 221.3809\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 619.8909  464.9167 \n\n\nBecause our p-value is less than our alpha of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The standard \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is associated with the term statistically significant. Therefore we could say here that the two performance groups have a statistically significant difference in mean sales.\nIn practice, there are numerous alphas that are of interest to analysts, each reflecting different levels of certainty. While 0.05 is the most common standard in many disciplines, more stringent alphas of 0.01 and 0.001 are often used in situations where a high degree of certainty is desirable (for example, some medical fields). Similarly, a less stringent alpha standard of 0.1 can be of interest particularly when sample sizes are small and the analyst is satisfied with ‘indications’ from the data. In many statistical software packages, including those that we will see in this book, tests that meet an \\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) standard are usually marked with period(.), those that meet \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with an asterisk(*), \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) a double asterisk(**) and \\(\\alpha = 0.001\\) a triple asterisk(***).\nMany leading statisticians have argued that p-values are more a test of sample size than anything else and have cautioned against too much of a focus on p-values in making statistical conclusions from data. In particular, situations where data and methodology have been deliberately manipulated to achieve certain alpha standards—a process known as ‘p-hacking’—has been of increasing concern recently. See Chapter 11 for a better understanding of how the significance level and the sample size contribute to determining statistical power in hypothesis testing.\n\n\n3.3.2 Testing for a non-zero correlation between two variables (\\(t\\)-test for correlation)\nImagine that we are given a sample of data for two variables and we are asked if the variables are correlated in the overall population. We can take a null hypothesis that the variables are not correlated, determine a t-statistic associated with a zero correlation and convert this to a p-value. The t-statistic associated with a correlation \\(r\\) between two samples of length \\(n\\) is often notated \\(t^*\\) and is defined as\n\\[\nt^* = \\frac{r\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}\n\\] \\(t^*\\) can be converted to an associated p-value using a \\(t\\)-distribution in a similar way to the previous section, this time with \\(n - 2\\) degrees of freedom in our \\(t\\)-distribution. As an example, let’s calculate \\(t^*\\) for the correlation between sales and customer rating in our sample and convert it to a p-value.\n\n# remove NAs from salespeople\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# calculate t_star\nr &lt;- cor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate)\nn &lt;- nrow(salespeople)\nt_star &lt;- (r*sqrt(n - 2))/sqrt(1 - r^2)\n\n# convert to p-value on t-distribution with n - 2 degrees of freedom\n2*pt(t_star, df = n - 2, lower = FALSE)\n\n[1] 8.647952e-11\n\n\nAgain, there is a useful function in R to cut out the need for all our manual calculations. The cor.test() function in R performs a hypothesis test on the null hypothesis that two variables have zero correlation.\n\ncor.test(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate)\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  salespeople$sales and salespeople$customer_rate\nt = 6.6952, df = 348, p-value = 8.648e-11\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2415282 0.4274964\nsample estimates:\n     cor \n0.337805 \n\n\nThis confirms our manual calculations, and we see the null hypothesis has been rejected and we can conclude that there is a significant correlation between sales and customer rating.\n\n\n3.3.3 Testing for a difference in frequency distribution between different categories in a data set (Chi-square test)\nImagine that we are asked if the performance category of each person in the salespeople data set has a relationship with their promotion likelihood. We will test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the distribution of promoted versus not promoted across the four performance categories.\nFirst we can produce a contingency table, which is a matrix containing counts of how many people were promoted or not promoted in each category.\n\n# create contingency table of promoted vs performance\n(contingency &lt;- table(salespeople$promoted, salespeople$performance))\n\n   \n     1  2  3  4\n  0 50 85 77 25\n  1 10 25 48 30\n\n\nWe can see by summing each row that for the total sample we can expect 113 people to be promoted and 237 to miss out on promotion. We can use this ratio to compute an expected proportion in each performance category under the assumption that the distribution was exactly the same across all four categories.\n\n# calculate expected promoted and not promoted\n(expected_promoted &lt;- (sum(contingency[2, ])/sum(contingency)) * \n   colSums(contingency))\n\n       1        2        3        4 \n19.37143 35.51429 40.35714 17.75714 \n\n(expected_notpromoted &lt;- (sum(contingency[1, ])/sum(contingency)) * \n    colSums(contingency))\n\n       1        2        3        4 \n40.62857 74.48571 84.64286 37.24286 \n\n\nNow we can compare our observed versus expected values using the difference metric:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\mathrm{observed} - \\mathrm{expected})^2}{\\mathrm{expected}}\n\\] and add these all up to get a total, known as the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic.\n\n# calculate the difference metrics for promoted and not promoted\npromoted &lt;- sum((expected_promoted - contingency[2, ])^2/\n                  expected_promoted)\n\nnotpromoted &lt;- sum((expected_notpromoted - contingency[1, ])^2/\n                     expected_notpromoted)\n\n# calculate chi-squared statistic\n(chi_sq_stat &lt;- notpromoted + promoted)\n\n[1] 25.89541\n\n\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic has an expected distribution that can be used to determine the p-value associated with this statistic. As with the \\(t\\)-distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. This is calculated by subtracting one from the number of rows and from the number of columns in the contingency table and multiplying them together. In this case we have 2 rows and 4 columns, which calculates to 3 degrees of freedom. Armed with our \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic and our degrees of freedom, we can now calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test using the pchisq() function.\n\n# calculate p-value from chi_squared stat\npchisq(chi_sq_stat, df = 3, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.003063e-05\n\n\nThe chisq.test() function in R performs all the steps involved in a chi-square test of independence on a contingency table and returns the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic and associated p-value for the null hypothesis, in this case confirming our manual calculations.\n\nchisq.test(contingency)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency\nX-squared = 25.895, df = 3, p-value = 1.003e-05\n\n\nAgain, we can reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in the distribution of promoted/not promoted individuals between the four performance categories.",

Linear regression will often be the first methodology to be trialed on a given problem, and will give an immediate benchmark with which to judge the efficacy of other, more complex, modeling techniques. Given the ease of interpretation, many analysts will select a linear regression model over more complex approaches even if those approaches produce a slightly better fit. This chapter will also introduce many critical concepts that will apply to other modeling approaches as we proceed through this book.

    "text": "4.1.1 Origins and intuition of linear regression\nLinear regression, also known as Ordinary Least Squares linear regression or OLS regression for short, was developed independently by the mathematicians Gauss and Legendre at or around the first decade of the 19th century, and there remains today some controversy about who should take credit for its discovery. However, at the time of its discovery it was not actually known as ‘regression’‍. This term became more popular following the work of Francis Galton—a British intellectual jack-of-all-trades and a cousin of Charles Darwin. In the late 1800s, Galton had researched the relationship between the heights of a population of almost 1000 children and the average height of their parents (mid-parent height). He was surprised to discover that there was not a perfect relationship between the height of a child and the average height of its parents, and that in general children’s heights were more likely to be in a range that was closer to the mean for the total population. He described this statistical phenomenon as a ‘regression towards mediocrity’ (‘regression’ comes from a Latin term approximately meaning ‘go back’).\nFigure 4.1 is a scatter plot of Galton’s data with the black solid line showing what a perfect relationship would look like, the black dot-dashed line indicating the mean child height and the red dashed line showing the actual relationship determined by Galton1. You can regard the red dashed line as ‘going back’ from the perfect relationship (symbolized by the black line). This might give you an intuition that will help you understand later sections of this chapter. In an arbitrary data set, the red dashed line can lie anywhere between the black dot-dashed line (no relationship) and the black solid line (a perfect relationship). Linear regression is about finding the red dashed line in your data and using it to explain the degree to which your input data (the \\(x\\) axis) explains your outcome data (the \\(y\\) axis).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Galton’s study of the height of children introduced the term ‘regression’\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Use cases for linear regression\nLinear regression is particularly suited to a problem where the outcome of interest is on some sort of continuous scale (for example, quantity, money, height, weight). For outcomes of this type, it can be a first port of call before trying more complex modeling approaches. It is simple and easy to explain, and analysts will often accept a somewhat poorer fit using linear regression in order to avoid having to interpret a more complex model.\nHere are some illustratory examples of questions that could be tackled with a linear regression approach:\n\nGiven a data set of demographic data, job data and current salary data, to what extent can current salary be explained by the rest of the data?\nGiven annual test scores for a set of students over a four-year period, what is the relationship between the final test score and earlier test scores?\nGiven a set of GPA data, SAT data and data on the percentile score on an aptitude test for a set of job applicants, to what extent can the GPA and SAT data explain the aptitude test score?\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are working as an analyst for the biology department of a large academic institution which offers a four-year undergraduate degree program. The academic leaders of the department are interested in understanding how student performance in the final-year examination of the degree program relates to performance in the prior three years.\nTo help with this, you have been provided with data for 975 individuals graduating in the past three years, and you have been asked to create a model to explain each individual’s final examination score based on their examination scores for the first three years of their program. The Year 1 examination scores are awarded on a scale of 0–100, Years 2 and 3 on a scale of 0–200, and the Final year is awarded on a scale of 0–300.\nWe will load the ugtests data set into our session and take a brief look at it.\n\n# if needed, download ugtests data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/ugtests.csv\"\nugtests &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# look at the first few rows of data\nhead(ugtests)\n\n  Yr1 Yr2 Yr3 Final\n1  27  50  52    93\n2  70 104 126   207\n3  27  36 148   175\n4  26  75 115   125\n5  46  77  75   114\n6  86 122 119   159\n\n\nThe data looks as expected, with test scores for four years all read in as numeric data types, but of course this is only a few rows.

We can also be assured that there is no missing data, as these would have been displayed as NA counts in our summary if they existed.\nWe can also plot our four years of test scores pairwise to see any initial relationships of interest, as displayed in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# display a pairplot of all four columns of data\nGGally::ggpairs(ugtests)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Pairplot of the ugtests data set\n\n\n\nIn the diagonal, we can see the distributions of the data in each column. We observe relatively normal-looking distributions in each year. We can see scatter plots and pairwise correlation statistics off the diagonal. For example, we see a particularly strong correlation between Yr3 and Final test scores, a moderate correlation between Yr2 and Final and relative independence elsewhere.",

    "section": "4.2 Simple linear regression",
    "text": "4.2 Simple linear regression\nIn order to visualize our approach and improve our intuition, we will start with simple linear regression, which is the case where there is only a single input variable and outcome variable.\n\n4.2.1 Linear relationship between a single input and an outcome\nLet our input variable be \\(x\\) and our outcome variable be \\(y\\). In Chapter 1, we introduced the concept of parametric modeling as an assumption that our outcome variable \\(y\\) is expected to be related to the input variable \\(x\\) by means of some mathematically definable function. In other words, we assume:\n\\[\ny = f(x) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is some mathematical transformation of \\(x\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is some random, uncontrollable error. Put another way, we assume that \\(f(x)\\) represents the mean expected value of \\(y\\) over many observations of \\(x\\), and that any single observation of \\(y\\) could vary from \\(f(x)\\) by an error of \\(\\epsilon\\). Since we are assuming that \\(f(x)\\) represents the mean of \\(y\\), our errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are therefore distributed around a mean of zero. We further assume that the distribution of our errors \\(\\epsilon\\) is a normal distribution2.\nRecalling the equation of a straight line, because we assume that the expected relationship is linear, it will take the form:\n\\[y = mx + c\\] where \\(m\\) represents the slope or gradient of the line, and \\(c\\) represents the point at which the line intercepts the \\(y\\) axis. When using a straight line to model a relationship in the data, we call \\(c\\) and \\(m\\) the coefficients of the model.\nNow let’s assume that we have a sample of 10 observations with which to estimate our linear relationship. Let’s take the first 10 values of Yr3 and Final in our ugtests data set:\n\n(d &lt;- head(ugtests[ , c(\"Yr3\", \"Final\")], 10))\n\n   Yr3 Final\n1   52    93\n2  126   207\n3  148   175\n4  115   125\n5   75   114\n6  119   159\n7  125   153\n8   78    84\n9  119   147\n10  67    80\n\n\nWe can do a simple plot of these observations as in Figure 4.3. Intuitively, we can imagine a line passing through these points that ‘fits’ the general pattern. For example, taking \\(m = 1.2\\) and \\(c = 5\\), the resulting line \\(y = 1.2x + 5\\) could fit between the points we are given, as displayed in Figure 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Basic scatter plot of 10 observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Fitting \\(y=1.2x + 5\\) to our 10 observations\n\n\n\nThis looks like an approximation of the relationship, but how do we know that it is the best approximation?\n\n\n4.2.2 Minimising the error\nRemember that our assumed relationship \\(y = mx + c\\) represents the expected mean value of \\(y\\) over many observations of \\(x\\). For a specific single observation of \\(x\\), we do not expect \\(y\\) to be precisely on our expected line, because each individual observation will have an error term \\(\\epsilon\\) either above or below the expected line. We can determine this error term \\(\\epsilon\\) in the fitted model by calculating the difference between the real value of \\(y\\) and the one predicted by our model. For example, at \\(x = 52\\), our modeled value of y is 67.4, but the real value is 93, producing an error \\(\\epsilon\\) of 25.6. These errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are known as the residuals of our model. The residuals for the 10 points in our data set are illustrated by the solid red line segments in Figure 4.5. It looks like at least one of our residuals is pretty large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Residuals of \\(y=1.2x + 5\\) for our 10 observations\n\n\n\nThe error of our model—which we want to minimize—could be defined in a number of ways:\n\nThe average of our residuals\nThe average of the absolute values of our residuals (so that negative values are converted to positive values)\nThe average of the squares of our residuals (note that all squares are positive)\n\nFor a number of reasons (not least the fact that at the time this method was developed it was one of the easiest to derive), the most common approach is number 3, which is why we call our regression model Ordinary Least Squares regression. Some algebra and calculus can help us determine the equation of the line that generates the least-squared residual error. For more of the theory behind this, consult Montgomery, Peck, and Vining (2012), but let’s look at how this works in practice.\n\n\n4.2.3 Determining the best fit\nWe can run a fairly simple function in R to calculate the best fit linear model for our data. Once we have run that function, the model and all the details will be saved in our session for further investigation or use.\nFirst we need to express the model we are looking to calculate as a formula. In this simple case, we want to regress the outcome \\(y =\\) Final against the input \\(x =\\) Yr3, and therefore we would use the simple formula notation Final ~ Yr3. Now we can use the lm() function to calculate the linear model based on our data set and our formula.\n\n# calculate model\nmodel &lt;- lm(formula = Final ~ Yr3, data = d)\n\nThe model object that we have created is a list of a number of different pieces of information, which we can see by looking at the names of the objects in the list.\n\n# view the names of the objects in the model\nnames(model) \n\n [1] \"coefficients\"  \"residuals\"     \"effects\"       \"rank\"         \n [5] \"fitted.values\" \"assign\"        \"qr\"            \"df.residual\"  \n [9] \"xlevels\"       \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"model\"        \n\n\nSo we can already see some terms we are familiar with. For example, we can look at the coefficients.\n\nmodel$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)         Yr3 \n  16.630452    1.143257 \n\n\nThis tells us that that our best fit model—the one that minimizes the average squares of the residuals—is \\(y = 1.14x + 16.63\\). In other words, our Final test score can be expected to take a value of 16.63 even with zero score in the Yr3 input, and every additional point scored in Yr3 will increase the Final score by 1.14.\n\n\n4.2.4 Measuring the fit of the model\nWe have calculated a model which minimizes the average squared residual error for the sample of data that we have, but we don’t really have a sense of how ‘good’ the model is. How do we tell how well our model uses the input data to explain the outcome? This is an important question to answer because you would not want to propose a model that does not do a good job of explaining your outcome, and you also may need to compare your model to other alternatives, which will require some sort of benchmark metric.\nOne natural way to benchmark how good a job your model does of explaining the outcome is to compare it to a situation where you have no input and no model at all. In this situation, all you have is your outcome values, which can be considered a random variable with a mean and a variance. In the case of our 10 observations, we have 10 values of Final with a mean of 133.7. We can consider the horizontal line representing the mean of \\(y\\) as our ‘random model’‍, and we can calculate the residuals around the mean. This can be seen in Figure 4.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Residuals of our 10 observations around their mean value\n\n\n\nRecall from Section 3.1.1 the definition of the population variance of \\(y\\), notated as \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y)\\). Note that it is defined as the average of the squares of the residuals around the mean of \\(y\\). Therefore \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y)\\) represents the average squared residual error of a random model. This calculates in this case to 1574.21. Let’s overlay our fitted model onto this random model in Figure 4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Comparison of residuals of fitted model (red) against random variable (blue)\n\n\n\nSo for most of our observations (though not all) we seem to have reduced the ‘distance’ from the random model by fitting our new model. If we average the square of our residuals for the fitted model, we obtain the average squared residual error of our fitted model, which calculates to 398.35.\nTherefore, before we fit our model, we have an error of 1574.21, and after we fit it, we have an error of 398.35. So we have reduced the error of our model by 1175.86 or, expressed as a proportion, by 0.75. In other words, we can say that our model explains 0.75 (or 75%) of the variance of our outcome.\nThis metric is known as the \\(R^2\\) of our model and is the primary metric used in measuring the fit of a linear regression model3.",

    "section": "4.3 Multiple linear regression",
    "text": "4.3 Multiple linear regression\nIn reality, regression problems rarely involve one single input variable, but rather multiple variables. The methodology for multiple linear regression is similar in nature to simple linear regression, but obviously more difficult to visualize because of its increased dimensionality.\nIn this case, our inputs are a set of \\(p\\) variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\). Extending the linear equation in Section 4.2.1, we seek to develop an equation of the form:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\\] so that our average squared residual error is minimized.\n\n4.3.1 Running a multiple linear regression model and interpreting its coefficients\nA multiple linear regression model is run in a similar way to a simple linear regression model, with your formula notation determining what outcome and input variables you wish to have in your model. Let’s now perform a multiple linear regression on our entire ugtests data set and regress our Final test score against all prior test scores using the formula Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1 and determine our coefficients as before.\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1)\nmodel$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)         Yr3         Yr2         Yr1 \n14.14598945  0.86568123  0.43128539  0.07602621 \n\n\nReferring to our formula in Section 4.3, let’s understand what each coefficient \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) means. \\(\\beta_0\\), the intercept of the model, represents the value of \\(y\\) assuming that all the inputs were zero. You can imagine that your output can be expected to have a base value even without any inputs—a student who completely flunked the first three years can still redeem themselves to some extent in the Final year.\nNow looking at the other coefficients, let’s consider what happens if our first input \\(x_1\\) increased by a single unit, assuming nothing else changed. We would then expect our value of y to increase by \\(\\beta_1\\). Similarly for any input \\(x_k\\), a unit increase would result in an increase in \\(y\\) of \\(\\beta_k\\), assuming no other changes in the inputs.\nIn the case of our ugtests data set, we can say the following:\n\nThe intercept of the model is 14.146. This is the value that a student could be expected to score on their final exam even if they had scored zero in all previous exams.\nThe Yr3 coefficient is 0.866. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 3 score.\nThe Yr2 coefficient is 0.431. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 2 score.\nThe Yr1 coefficient is 0.076. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 1 score.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Coefficient confidence\nIntuitively, these coefficients appear too precise for comfort. After all, we are attempting to estimate a relationship based on a limited set of data. In particular, looking at the Yr1 coefficient, it seems to be very close to zero, implying that there is a possibility that the Year 1 examination score has no impact on the final examination score. Like in any statistical estimation, the coefficients calculated for our model have a margin of error. Typically, in any such situation, we seek to know a 95% confidence interval to set a standard of certainty around the values we are interpreting.\nThe summary() function is a useful way to gather critical information in your model, including important statistics on your coefficients:\n\nmodel_summary &lt;- summary(model)\nmodel_summary$coefficients\n\n               Estimate Std. Error   t value      Pr(&gt;|t|)\n(Intercept) 14.14598945 5.48005618  2.581358  9.986880e-03\nYr3          0.86568123 0.02913754 29.710169 1.703293e-138\nYr2          0.43128539 0.03250783 13.267124  4.860109e-37\nYr1          0.07602621 0.06538163  1.162807  2.451936e-01\n\n\nThe 95% confidence interval corresponds to approximately two standard errors above or below the estimated value. For a given coefficient, if this confidence interval includes zero, you cannot reject the hypothesis that the variable has no relationship with the outcome. Another indicator of this is the Pr(&gt;|t|) column of the coefficient summary, which represents the p-value of the null hypothesis that the input variable has no relationship with the outcome. If this value is less than a certain threshold (usually 0.05), you can conclude that this variable has a statistically significant relationship with the outcome. To see the precise confidence intervals for your model coefficients, you can use the confint() function.\n\nconfint(model)\n\n                  2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept)  3.39187185 24.9001071\nYr3          0.80850142  0.9228610\nYr2          0.36749170  0.4950791\nYr1         -0.05227936  0.2043318\n\n\nIn this case, we can conclude that the examinations in Years 2 and 3 have a significant relationship with the Final examination score, but we cannot conclude this for Year 1. Effectively, this means that we can drop Yr1 from our model with no substantial loss of fit. In general, simpler models are easier to manage and interpret, so let’s remove the non-significant variable now.\n\nnewmodel &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2)\n\nGiven that our new model only has three dimensions, we have the luxury of visualizing it. Figure 4.9 shows the data and the fitted plane of our model.\n\n\n\n#| fig.align: \"center\"\n#| echo: false\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nplot_ly(data = ugtests) |&gt;\n  add_trace(x = ~Yr3, y = ~Yr2, z = ~Final, mode = \"markers\", type = \"scatter3d\",\n            marker = list(size = 5, color = \"blue\", symbol = 104), name = \"Observations\") |&gt; \n  add_trace(z = newmodel$fitted.values, x = ~Yr3, y = ~Yr2, type = \"mesh3d\", \n            name = \"Fitted values\") |&gt;\n  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Yr3'), yaxis = list(title = 'Yr2'),\n                      camera = list(eye = list(x = -1.5, y = 1.75, z = 0)),\n                      zaxis = list(title = 'Final'), aspectmode='cube')) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: 3D visualization of the fitted newmodel against the ugtests data\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Model ‘goodness-of-fit’\nAt this point we can further explore the overall summary of our model. As you saw in the previous section, our model summary contains numerous objects of interest, including statistics on the coefficients of our model. We can see what is inside our summary by looking at the names of its contents, and we can then dive in and explore specific objects of interest.\n\n# get summary of model\nnewmodel_summary &lt;- summary(newmodel)\n\n# see summary contents\nnames(newmodel_summary)\n\n [1] \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"residuals\"     \"coefficients\" \n [5] \"aliased\"       \"sigma\"         \"df\"            \"r.squared\"    \n [9] \"adj.r.squared\" \"fstatistic\"    \"cov.unscaled\" \n\n\n\n# view r-squared\nnewmodel_summary$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.5296734\n\n\nWe can see that our model explains more than half of the variance in the Final examination score. Alternatively, we can view the entire summary to receive a formatted report on our model.\n\n# see full model summary\nnewmodel_summary\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2, data = ugtests)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-91.12 -20.36  -0.22  18.94  98.29 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In particular, the last line gives us a report on our overall model confidence or ‘goodness-of-fit’—this is a hypothesis test on the null hypothesis that our model does not fit the data any better than a random model. A high F-statistic indicates a strong likelihood that the model fits the data better than a random model. More intuitively, perhaps, we also have the p-value for the F-statistic. In this case it is extremely small, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our model has significant explanatory power over and above a random model.\nBe careful not to confuse model goodness-of-fit with \\(R^2\\). Depending on your sample, it is entirely possible for a model with a low \\(R^2\\) to have high certainty for goodness-of-fit and vice versa.\n\n\n4.3.4 Making predictions from your model\nWhile this book focuses on inferential rather than predictive analytics, we briefly touch here on the mechanics of generating predictions from models. As you might imagine, once the model has been fitted, prediction is a relatively straightforward process. We feed the Yr2 and Yr3 examination scores into our fitted model, and it applies the coefficients to calculate the predicted outcome. Let’s look at three fictitious students and create a dataframe with their scores to input into the model.\n\n(new_students &lt;- data.frame(\n  Yr2 = c(67, 23, 88), \n  Yr3 = c(144, 100, 166)\n))\n\n  Yr2 Yr3\n1  67 144\n2  23 100\n3  88 166\n\n\nNow we can feed these values into our model to get predictions of the Final examination result for our three new students.\n\n# use newmodel to predict for new_students\npredict(newmodel, new_students)\n\n       1        2        3 \n171.6093 114.5273 199.7179 \n\n\nBecause we are modeling the expected value of the Final examination result, this prediction represents the expected mean over many students with the same scores in previous years examinations. We know from our earlier work in this chapter that there is a confidence interval around the coefficients of our model, which means that there is a range of values for our expected Final score according to those confidence intervals. This can be determined by specifying that you require a confidence interval for your predictions.\n\n# get a confidence interval \npredict(newmodel, new_students, interval = \"confidence\")\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 171.6093 168.2125 175.0061\n2 114.5273 109.7081 119.3464\n3 199.7179 195.7255 203.7104\n\n\nAs an example, another way of interpreting the confidence interval is to say that, if you have many students who scored precisely 67 and 144 in the Year 2 and Year 3 examinations respectively, we expect the mean Final score of these students to be somewhere between 168 and 175.\nYou may also recall from Section 4.2.1 that any prediction of an individual observation is subject to an error term \\(\\epsilon\\). Therefore, to generate a more reliable prediction range for an individual observation, you should calculate a ‘prediction interval’‍.\n\n# get a prediction interval \npredict(newmodel, new_students, interval = \"prediction\")\n\n       fit       lwr      upr\n1 171.6093 111.77795 231.4406\n2 114.5273  54.59835 174.4562\n3 199.7179 139.84982 259.5860\n\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the process of developing a model to predict an outcome can be quite different from developing a model to explain an outcome. For a start, it is unlikely that you would use your entire sample to fit a predictive model, as you would want to reserve a portion of your data to test for its fit on new data. Since the focus of this book is inferential modeling, much of this topic will be out of our scope.",

    "section": "4.4 Managing inputs in linear regression",
    "text": "4.4 Managing inputs in linear regression\nOur walkthrough example for this chapter, while useful for illustrating the key concepts, is a very straightforward data set to run a model on. There is no missing data, and all the data inputs have the same numeric data type (in the exercises at the end of this chapter we will present a more varied data set for analysis). Commonly, an analyst will have a list of possible input variables that they can consider in their model, and rarely will they run a model using all of these variables. In this section we will cover some common elements of decision making and design of input variables in regression models.\n\n4.4.1 Relevance of input variables\nThe first step in managing your input variables is to make a judgment about their relevance to the outcome being modeled. Analysts should not blindly run a model on a set of variables before considering their relevance. There are two common reasons for rejecting the inclusion of an input variable:\n\nThere is no reasonable possibility of a direct or indirect causal relationship between the input and the outcome. For example, if you were provided with the height of each individual taking the Final examination in our walkthrough example, it would be difficult to see how that could reasonably relate to the outcome that you are modeling.\nIf there is a possibility that the model will be used to predict based on new data in the future, there may be variables that you explicitly do not wish to be used in any prediction. For example, if our walkthrough model contained student gender data, we would not want to include that in a model that predicted future student scores because we would not want gender to be taken into consideration when determining student performance.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Sparseness (‘missingness’) of data\nMissing data is a very common problem in modeling. If an observation has missing data in a variable that is being included in the model, that observation will be ignored, or an error will be thrown. This forces a model trained on a smaller set of data, which can compromise its powers of inference. Running summary functions on your data (such as summary() in R) will reveal variables that contain missing data if they exist.\nThere are three main options for how missing data is handled:\n\nIf the data for a given variable is relatively complete and only a small number of observations are missing, it’s usually best and simplest to remove the observations that are missing from the data set. Note that many modeling functions (though not all) will take care of this automatically.\nAs data becomes more sparse, removing observations becomes less of an option. If the sparseness is massive (for example, more than half of the data is missing), then there is no choice but to remove that variable from the model. While this may be unsatisfactory for a given variable (because it is thought to have an important explanatory role), the fact remains that data that is mostly missing is not a good measure of a construct in the first place.\nModerate sparse data could be considered for imputation. Imputation methods involve using the overall statistical properties of the entire data set or of specific other variables to ‘suggest’ what the missing value might be, ranging from simple mean and median values to more complex imputation methods. Imputation methods are more commonly used in predictive settings, and we will not cover imputation methods in depth here.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Transforming categorical inputs to dummy variables\nMany models will have categorical inputs rather than numerical inputs. Categorical inputs usually take forms such as:\n\nBinary values—for example, Yes/No, True/False\nUnordered categories—for example Car, Train, Bicycle\nOrdered categories—for example Low, Medium, High\n\nCategorical variables do not behave like numerical variables. There is no sense of quantity in a categorical variable. We do not know how a Car relates to a Train quantitatively, we only know that they are different. Even for an ordered category, although we know that ‘Medium’ is higher than ‘Low’‍, we do not know how much higher or indeed whether the difference is the same as that between ‘High’ and ‘Medium’‍.\nIn general, all model input variables should take a numeric form. The most reliable way to do this is to convert categorical values to dummy variables. While some packages and functions have a built-in ability to convert categorical data to dummy variables, not all do, so it is important to know how to do this yourself. Consider the following data set:\n\n(vehicle_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  make = factor(c(\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Audi\")), \n  manufacturing_cost = c(15000, 19000, 28000)\n))\n\n    make manufacturing_cost\n1   Ford              15000\n2 Toyota              19000\n3   Audi              28000\n\n\nThe make data is categorical, so it will be converted to several columns for each possible value of make, and binary labeling will be used to identify whether that value is present in that specific observation. Many packages and functions are available to conveniently do this, for example:\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n(dummy_vehicle &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(vehicle_data, \n                                           basal_level = TRUE))\n\n  make_Audi make_Ford make_Toyota manufacturing_cost\n1         0         1           0              15000\n2         0         0           1              19000\n3         1         0           0              28000\n\n\nIt is worth a moment to consider how to interpret coefficients of dummy variables in a linear regression model. Note that all observations will have one of the dummy variable values (all cars must have a make). Therefore the model will assume a ‘reference value’ for the categorical variable—often this is the first value in alphabetical or numerical order. In this case, Audi would be the reference dummy variable. The model then calculates the effect on the outcome variable of a ‘switch’ from Audi to one of the other dummies4. If we were to try to use the data in our vehicle_data_dummies data set to explain the retail price of a vehicle, we would interpret coefficients like this:\n\nComparing two cars of the same make, we would expect each extra dollar spent on manufacturing to change the retail price by …\nComparing a Ford with an Audi of the same manufacturing cost, we would expect a difference in retail price of …\nComparing a Toyota with an Audi of the same manufacturing cost, we would expect a difference in retail price of …\n\nThis highlights the importance of appropriate interpretation of coefficients, and in particular the proper understanding of units. It will be common to see much larger coefficients for dummy variables in regression models because they represent a binary ‘all’ or ‘nothing’ variable in the model. The coefficient for manufacturing cost would be much smaller because a unit in this case is a dollar of manufacturing spend, on a scale of many thousands of potential dollars in spend. Care should be taken not to ‘rank’ coefficients by their value. Higher coefficients in and of themselves do not imply greater importance5.",

    "section": "4.5 Testing your model assumptions",
    "text": "4.5 Testing your model assumptions\nAll modeling techniques have underlying assumptions about the data that they model and can generate inaccurate results when those assumptions do not hold true. Conscientious analysts will verify that these assumptions are satisfied before finalizing their modeling efforts. In this section we will outline some common checks of model assumptions when running linear regression models.\n\n4.5.1 Assumption of linearity and additivity\nLinear regression assumes that the relationship we are trying to model is linear and additive in nature. Therefore you can expect problems if you are using this approach to model a pattern that is not linear or additive.\nYou can check whether your linearity assumption was reasonable in a couple of ways. You can plot the true versus the predicted (fitted) values to see if they look correlated. You can see such a plot on our student examination model in Figure 4.10.\n\n\n\n\npredicted_values &lt;- newmodel$fitted.values\ntrue_values &lt;- ugtests$Final\n\n# plot true values against predicted values\nplot(predicted_values, true_values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Plot of true versus fitted/predicted student scores\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can plot the residuals of your model against the predicted values and look for the pattern of a random distribution (that is, no major discernible pattern) such as in Figure 4.11.\n\n\n\n\nresiduals &lt;- newmodel$residuals\n\n# plot residuals against predicted values\nplot(predicted_values, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Plot of residuals against fitted/predicted scores\n\n\n\nYou can also plot the residuals against each input variable as an extra check of independent randomness, looking for a reasonably random distribution in all cases. If you find that your residuals are following a clear pattern and are not random in nature, this is an indication that a linear model is not a good choice for your data.\n\n\n4.5.2 Assumption of constant error variance\nIt is assumed in a linear model that the errors or residuals are homoscedastic—this means that their variance is constant across the values of the input variables. If the errors of your model are heteroscedastic—that is, if they increase or decrease according to the value of the model inputs—this can lead to poor estimations and inaccurate inferences.\nWhile a simple plot of residuals against predicted values (such as in Figure 4.11) can give a quick indication on homoscedacity, to be thorough the residuals should be plotted against each input variable, and it should be verified that the range of the residuals remains broadly stable. In our student examination model, we can first plot the residuals against the values of Yr2 in Figure 4.12.\n\n\n\n\nYr2 &lt;- ugtests$Yr2\n\n# plot residuals against Yr2 values\nplot(Yr2, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Plot of residuals against Yr2 values\n\n\n\nWe see a pretty consistent range of values for the residuals in Figure 4.12. Similarly we can plot the residuals against the values of Yr3, as in Figure 4.13.\n\n\n\n\nYr3 &lt;- ugtests$Yr3\n\n# plot residuals against Yr3 values\nplot(Yr3, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Plot of residuals against Yr3 values\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13 also shows a consistent range of values for the residuals, which reassures us that we have homoscedacity.\n\n\n4.5.3 Assumption of normally distributed errors\nRecall from Section 4.2.1 that one of the assumptions when we run a linear regression model is that the residuals of the model are normally distributed around a mean of zero. Therefore it is useful to check your data to see how well it fits these assumptions. If your data shows that the residuals have a substantially non-normal distribution, this may tell you something about your model and how well you can rely on it for accurate inferences or predictions.\nWhen residuals violate this assumption, it means that the ingoing mathematical premise of your model does not fully describe your data. Whether or not this is a big problem depends on the existing properties of your sample and on other model diagnostics. In models built on smaller samples, where hypothesis test criteria are only narrowly met, residual non-normality could present a significant challenge to the reliability of inferences and predictions. On models where hypothesis test criteria are very comfortably met, residual non-normality is less likely to be a problem (Lumley et al. (2002)). In any case, it is good practice to examine the distribution of your residuals so that you can refine or improve your model.\nThe quickest way to determine if residuals in your sample are consistent with a normal distribution is to run a quantile-quantile plot (or Q-Q plot) on the residuals. This will plot the observed quantiles of your sample against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. The closer this plot looks like a perfect correlation, the more certain you can be that this normality assumption holds. An example for our student examination model is in Figure 4.14.\n\n\n\n\n# normal distribution qqplot of residuals\nqqnorm(newmodel$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Quantile-quantile plot of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Avoiding high collinearity and multicollinearity between input variables\nIn multiple linear regression, the various input variables used can be considered ‘dimensions’ of the problem or model. In theory, we ideally expect dimensions to be independent and uncorrelated. Practically speaking, however, it’s very challenging in large data sets to ensure that every input variable is completely uncorrelated from another. For example, even in our limited ugtests data set we saw in Figure 4.2 that Yr2 and Yr3 examination scores are correlated to some degree.\nWhile some correlation between input variables can be expected and tolerated in linear regression models, high levels of correlation can result in significant inflation of coefficients and inaccurate estimates of p-values of coefficients.\nCollinearity means that two input variables are highly correlated. The definition of ‘high correlation’ is a matter of judgment, but as a rule of thumb correlations greater than 0.5 might be considered high and greater than 0.7 might be considered extreme. Creating a simple correlation matrix or a pairplot (such as Figure 4.2) can immediately surface high or extreme collinearity.\nMulticollinearity means that there is a linear relationship between more than two of the input variables. This may not always present itself in the form of high correlations between pairs of input variables, but may be seen by identifying ‘clusters’ of moderately correlated variables, or by calculating a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each input variable—where VIFs greater than 5 indicate high multicollinearity. Easy-to-use tests also exist in statistical software for identifying multicollinearity (for example the mctest package in R). Here is how we would test for multicollinearity in our student examination model.\n\nlibrary(mctest)\n\n# diagnose possible overall presence of multicollinearity\nmctest::omcdiag(newmodel)\n\n\nCall:\nmctest::omcdiag(mod = newmodel)\n\n\nOverall Multicollinearity Diagnostics\n\n                       MC Results detection\nDeterminant |X'X|:         0.9981         0\nFarrar Chi-Square:         1.8365         0\nRed Indicator:             0.0434         0\nSum of Lambda Inverse:     2.0038         0\nTheil's Method:           -0.5259         0\nCondition Number:          9.1952         0\n\n1 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is detected by the test \n0 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test\n\n\n\n# if necessary, diagnose specific multicollinear variables using VIF \nmctest::imcdiag(newmodel, method = \"VIF\")\n\n\nCall:\nmctest::imcdiag(mod = newmodel, method = \"VIF\")\n\n\n VIF Multicollinearity Diagnostics\n\n       VIF detection\nYr3 1.0019         0\nYr2 1.0019         0\n\nNOTE:  VIF Method Failed to detect multicollinearity\n\n\n0 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test\n\n===================================\n\n\nNote that collinearity and multicollinearity only affect the coefficients of the variables impacted, and do not affect other variables or the overall statistics and fit of a model. Therefore, if a model is being developed primarily to make predictions and there is little interest in using the model to explain a phenomenon, there may not be any need to address this issue at all. However, in inferential modeling the accuracy of the coefficients is very important, and so testing of multicollinearity is essential. In general, the best way to deal with collinear variables is to remove one of them from the model (usually the one that has the least significance in explaining the outcome).",

    "section": "4.6 Extending multiple linear regression",
    "text": "4.6 Extending multiple linear regression\nBy introducing some extensions of linear regression to relax the linear or additive assumptions, we can try to improve the overall fit of a model. It is rare for practitioners to extend linear regression models too greatly due to the negative impact this can have on interpretation, but simple extensions such as experimenting with interaction terms or quadratics are not uncommon. If you have an appetite to explore this topic more fully, I recommend Rao et al. (2008).\n\n4.6.1 Interactions between input variables\nRecall that our model of student examination scores took each year’s score as an independent input variable, and therefore we are making the assumption that the score obtained in each year acts independently and additively in predicting the Final score. However, it is very possible that several input variables act together in relation to the outcome. One way of modeling this is to include interaction terms in your model, which are new input variables formed as products of the original input variables.\nIn our student examination data in ugtests, we could consider extending our model to not only include the individual year examinations, but also to include the impact of combined changes across multiple years. For example, we could combine the impact of Yr2 and Yr3 examinations by multiplying them together in our model.\n\ninteraction_model &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, \n                        formula = Final ~ Yr2 + Yr3 + Yr2*Yr3)\nsummary(interaction_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Final ~ Yr2 + Yr3 + Yr2 * Yr3, data = ugtests)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-78.084 -18.284  -0.546  18.395  79.824 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Let’s take a moment to understand how to interpret this, since we note that some of the coefficients are now negative.\nOur model now includes two input variables and their interaction, so it can be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Final} &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2} + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr3}\\mathrm{Yr2} \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr2})\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2} \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\gamma\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr2}\\). Therefore our model has coefficients which are not constant but change with the values of the input variables. We can conclude that the effect of an extra point in the examination in Year 3 will be different depending on how the student performed in Year 2. Visualizing this, we can see in Figure 4.16 that this non-constant term introduces a curvature to our fitted surface that aligns it a little more closely with the observations in our data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: 3D visualization of the fitted interaction_model against the ugtests data\n\n\nBy examining the shape of this curved plane, we can observe that the model considers trajectories in the Year 2 and Year 3 examination scores. Those individuals who have improved from one year to the next will perform better in this model than those who declined. To demonstrate, let’s look at the predicted scores from our interaction_model for someone who declined and for someone who improved from Year 2 to Year 3.\n\n# data frame with a declining and an improving observation\nobs &lt;- data.frame(\n  Yr2 = c(150, 75),\n  Yr3 = c(75, 150)\n)\n\npredict(interaction_model, obs)\n\n       1        2 \n127.5010 170.1047 \n\n\nThrough including the interaction effect, the model interprets declining examination scores more negatively than improving examination scores. These kinds of additional inferential insights may be of great interest. However, consider the impact on interpretability of modeling too many combinations of interactions. As always, there is a trade-off between intepretability and accuracy6.\nWhen running models with interaction terms, you can expect to see a hierarchy in the coefficients according to the level of the interaction. For example, single terms will usually generate higher coefficients than interactions of two terms, which will generate higher coefficients than interactions of three terms, and so on. Given this, whenever an interaction of terms is considered significant in a model, then the single terms contained in that interaction should automatically be regarded as significant.\n\n\n4.6.2 Quadratic and higher-order polynomial terms\nIn many situations the real underlying relationship between the outcome and the inputs may be non-linear. For example, if the underlying relationship was thought to be quadratic on a given input variable \\(x\\), then the formula would take the form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2x^2\\). We can easily trial polynomial terms using our linear model technology.\nFor example, recall that we removed Yr1 data from our model because it was not significant when modeled linearly. We could test if a quadratic model on Yr1 helps improve our fit7:\n\n# add a quadratic term in Yr1\nquadratic_yr1_model &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, \n                          formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1 + I(Yr1^2))\n\n# test R-squared\nsummary(quadratic_yr1_model)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.5304198\n\n\nIn this case we find that modeling Yr1 as a quadratic makes no difference to the fit of the model.",

    "text": "5.1 When to use it\nIn the previous chapter we looked at how to explain outcomes that have continuous scale, such as quantity, money, height or weight. While there are a number of typical outcomes of this type in the people analytics domain, they are not the most common form of outcomes that are typically modeled. Much more common are situations where the outcome of interest takes the form of a limited set of classes. Binary (two class) problems are very common. Hiring, promotion and attrition are often modeled as binary outcomes: for example ‘Promoted’ or ‘Not promoted’. Multi-class outcomes like performance ratings on an ordinal scale, or survey responses on a Likert scale are often converted to binary outcomes by dividing the ratings into two groups, for example ‘High’ and ‘Not High’.\nIn any situation where our outcome is binary, we are effectively working with likelihoods. These are not generally linear in nature, and so we no longer have the comfort of our inputs being directly linearly related to our outcome. Therefore direct linear regression methods such as Ordinary Least Squares regression are not well suited to outcomes of this type. Instead, linear relationships can be inferred on transformations of the outcome variable, which gives us a path to building interpretable models. Hence, binomial logistic regression is said to be in a class of generalized linear models or GLMs. Understanding logistic regression and using it reliably in practice is not straightforward, but it is an invaluable skill to have in the people analytics domain. The mathematics of this chapter is a little more involved but worth the time investment in order to build a competent understanding of how to interpret these types of models.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Origins and intuition of binomial logistic regression\nImagine that we have a set of observations of data that are binary or dichotomous in nature. For convenience, let’s call the two values the data can take as ‘success’ and ‘failure’. Let’s say that the probability of an observation being a success is \\(p\\), and therefore the probability of an observation being a failure is \\(1 - p\\).\nLet’s also imagine we take a sample of \\(n\\) observations at random, with each observation being independent of the other. Then the number of successes in the sample, which we will call \\(Y\\), will follow a binomial distribution with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). The probability of observing exactly \\(k\\) successes in our sample is given by the formula:\n\\[\nP(Y = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways of choosing \\(k\\) successes from \\(n\\) observations. Here is the distribution of \\(Y\\) for \\(n = 100\\) and \\(p = 0.3\\), shown in Figure 5.1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Binomial distribution showing the probability of \\(k\\) successes in 100 observations with a success probability of 0.3\n\n\n\nNow, although the outcome variable \\(Y\\) here is discrete (can only take non-negative integer values), we can see that the shape of \\(Y\\) resembles a normal distribution. In fact, as long as \\(n\\) is not very small and \\(p\\) is not very biased1, the binomial distribution can be well approximated by a normal distribution with mean \\(np\\) and variance \\(np(1 - p)\\) (standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{np(1-p)}\\)) as shown in Figure 5.2 for \\(n = 100\\) and \\(p = 0.3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Binomial distribution with \\(n = 100\\), \\(p = 0.3\\) (blue bars) and normal approximation with \\(\\mu = 30\\), \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{21}\\) (red line)\n\n\n\nNow if we consider tha cumulative probability of \\(Y\\), that is, the probability of observing up to and including \\(k\\) successes, we can see that this cumulative probability takes on an S-shape, which is also well approximated by the cumulative normal distribution, as shown in Figure 5.3 for \\(n = 100\\) and \\(p = 0.3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be interested in modeling this cumulative probability of success, in order to understand how various input variables might influence it. Now that we know that it is well approximated by the normal distribution, we can use a function that has very similar charateristics to the normal distribution, but is easier to work with mathematically: called the logistic function.\nThe logistic function was first introduced by the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst in the early 1800s as a tool for modeling population growth for humans, animals and certain species of plants and fruits. By this time, it was generally accepted that population growth could not continue exponentially forever, and that there were environmental and resource limits which place a maximum limit on the size of a population. The formula for Verhulst’s function was:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_0)}}\n\\] where \\(e\\) is the exponential constant, \\(x_0\\) is the value of \\(x\\) at the midpoint, \\(L\\) is the maximum value of \\(y\\) (known as the ‘carrying capacity’) and \\(k\\) is the maximum gradient of the curve.\nThe logistic function, as shown in Figure 5.3 (a), was felt to accurately capture the theorized stages of population growth, with slower growth in the initial stage, moving to exponential growth during the intermediate stage and then to slower growth as the population approaches its carrying capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Verhulst’s logistic function modeled both the exponential nature and the natural limit of population growth\n\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, starting with applications in economics and in chemistry, the logistic function was adopted in a wide array of fields as a useful tool for modeling phenomena. In statistics, it was observed that the logistic function has a similar S-shape (or sigmoid) to a cumulative normal distribution of probability, as depicted in Figure 5.3 (b)2, where the \\(x\\) scale represents standard deviations around a mean. As we will learn, the logistic function gives rise to a mathematical model where the coefficients are easily interpreted in terms of likelihood of the outcome. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the logistic model soon became a common approach to modeling probabilistic phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The logistic function (blue dashed line) is very similar to a cumulative normal distribution (red solid line) but easier to interpret\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Use cases for binomial logistic regression\nBinomial logistic regression can be used when the outcome of interest is binary or dichotomous in nature. That is, it takes one of two values. For example, one or zero, true or false, yes or no. These classes are commonly described as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ classes. There is an underlying assumption that the cumulative probability of the outcome takes a shape similar to a cumulative normal distribution.\nHere are some example questions that could be approached using binomial logistic regression:\n\nGiven a set of data about sales managers in an organization, including performance against targets, team size, tenure in the organization and other factors, what influence do these factors have on the likelihood of the individual receiving a high performance rating?\nGiven a set of demographic, income and location data, what influence does each have on the likelihood of an individual voting in an election?\nGiven a set of statistics about the in-game activity of soccer players, what relationship does each statistic have with the likelihood of a player scoring a goal?\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst for a large company consisting of regional sales teams across the country. Twice every year, this company promotes some of its salespeople. Promotion is at the discretion of the head of each regional sales team, taking into consideration financial performance, customer satisfaction ratings, recent performance ratings and personal judgment.\nYou are asked by the management of the company to conduct an analysis to determine how the factors of financial performance, customer ratings and performance ratings influence the likelihood of a given salesperson being promoted. You are provided with a data set containing data for the last three years of salespeople considered for promotion. The salespeople data set contains the following fields:\n\npromoted: A binary value indicating 1 if the individual was promoted and 0 if not\nsales: the sales (in thousands of dollars) attributed to the individual in the period of the promotion\ncustomer_rate: the average satisfaction rating from a survey of the individual’s customers during the promotion period\nperformance: the most recent performance rating prior to promotion, from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest)\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the data.\n\n# if needed, download salespeople data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv\"\nsalespeople &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# look at the first few rows of data\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nThe data looks as expected. Let’s get a summary of the data.\n\nsummary(salespeople)\n\n    promoted          sales       customer_rate    performance \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :151.0   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:389.2   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :0.0000   Median :475.0   Median :3.620   Median :3.0  \n Mean   :0.3219   Mean   :527.0   Mean   :3.608   Mean   :2.5  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:667.2   3rd Qu.:4.290   3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :945.0   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :4.0  \n                  NA's   :1       NA's   :1       NA's   :1    \n\n\nFirst we see a small number of missing values, and we should remove those observations. We see that about a third of individuals were promoted, that sales ranged from $151k to $945k, that as expected the average satisfaction ratings range from 1 to 5, and finally we see four performance ratings, although the performance categories are numeric when they should be an ordered factor, and promoted is numeric when it should be categorical. Let’s convert these, and then let’s do a pairplot to get a quick view on some possible underlying relationships, as in Figure 5.3 (a).\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# remove NAs\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# convert performance to ordered factor and promoted to categorical\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- ordered(salespeople$performance, \n                                   levels = 1:4)\nsalespeople$promoted &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$promoted)\n\n# generate pairplot\nGGally::ggpairs(salespeople)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pairplot for the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nWe can see from this pairplot that there are clearly higher sales for those who are promoted versus those who are not. We also see a moderate relationship between customer rating and sales, which is intuitive (if the customer doesn’t think much of you, sales wouldn’t likely be very high).\nSo we can see that some relationships with our outcome may exist here, but it’s not clear how to tease them out and quantify them relative to each other. Let’s explore how binomial logistic regression can help us do this.\n\n\n5.2 Modeling probabilistic outcomes using a logistic function\nImagine that you have an outcome event \\(y\\) which either occurs or does not occur. The probability of \\(y\\) occurring, or \\(P(y = 1)\\), obviously takes a value between 0 and 1. Now imagine that some input variable \\(x\\) has a positive effect on the probability of the event occurring. Then you would naturally expect \\(P(y = 1)\\) to increase as \\(x\\) increases.\nIn our salespeople data set, let’s plot our promotion outcome against the sales input. This can be seen in Figure 5.3 (a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plot of promotion against sales in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that promotion is more likely with higher sales levels. As we move along the \\(x\\) axis from left to right and gradually include more and more individuals with higher sales, we know that the probability of promotion is gradually increasing overall. We could try to model this probability using our logistic function, which we learned about in Section 5.1.1. For example, let’s plot the logistic function \\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_{0})}}\n\\]\non this data, where we set \\(x_0\\) to the mean of sales and \\(k\\) to be some maximum gradient value. In Figure 5.3 (b) we can see these logistic functions for different values of \\(k\\). All of these seem to reflect the pattern we are observing to some extent, but how do we determine the best-fitting logistic function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Overlaying logistic functions with various gradients onto previous plot\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Deriving the concept of log odds\nLet’s look more carefully at the index of the exponential constant \\(e\\) in the denominator of our logistic function. Note that, because \\(x_{0}\\) is a constant, we have:\n\\[\n-k(x - x_{0}) = -(-kx_{0} + kx) = -(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_1x)\n\\] where \\(\\beta_0 = -kx_0\\) and \\(\\beta_{1} = k\\). Therefore,\n\\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\]\nThis equation makes intuitive sense. As the value of \\(x\\) increases, the value \\(e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}\\) gets smaller and smaller towards zero, and thus \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches its theoretical maximum value of 1. As the value of \\(x\\) decreases towards zero, we see that the value of \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches a minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta_0}}\\). Referring back to our salespeople example, we can thus see that \\(\\beta_0\\) helps determine the baseline probability of promotion assuming no sales at all. If \\(\\beta_0\\) has an extremely negative value, this baseline probability will approach its theoretical minimum of zero.\nLet’s formalize the role of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in the likelihood of a positive outcome. We know that for any binary event \\(y\\), \\(P(y = 0)\\) is equal to \\(1 - P(y = 1)\\), so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(y = 0) &= 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)} - 1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPutting these together, we find that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}}{\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nor alternatively, if we apply the natural logarithm to both sides\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\n\\]\nThe right-hand side should look familiar from the previous chapter on linear regression, meaning there is something here we can model linearly. But what is the left-hand side?\n\\(P(y = 1)\\) is the probability that the event will occur, while \\(P(y = 0)\\) is the probability that the event will not occur. You may be familiar from sports like horse racing or other gambling situations that the ratio of these two represents the odds of an event. For example, if a given horse has odds of 1:4, this means that there is a 20% probability they will win and an 80% probability they will not3.\nTherefore we can conclude that the natural logarithm of the odds of \\(y\\)—usually termed the log odds of \\(y\\)—is linear in \\(x\\), and therefore we can model the log odds of \\(y\\) using similar linear regression methods to those studied in Chapter 44.\n\n\n5.2.2 Modeling the log odds and interpreting the coefficients\nLet’s take our simple case of regressing the promoted outcome against sales. We use a standard binomial GLM function and our standard formula notation which we learned in the previous chapter.\n\n# run a binomial model \nsales_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales, \n                   data = salespeople, family = \"binomial\")\n\n# view the coefficients\nsales_model$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n-21.77642020   0.03675848 \n\n\nWe can interpret the coefficients as follows:\n\nThe (Intercept) coefficient is the value of the log odds with zero input value of \\(x\\)—it is the log odds of promotion if you made no sales.\nThe sales coefficient represents the increase in the log odds of promotion associated with each unit increase in sales.\n\nWe can convert these coefficients from log odds to odds by applying the exponent function, to return to the identity we had previously\n\\[\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x} = e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^x\n\\]\nFrom this, we can interpret that \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the base odds of promotion assuming no sales, and that for every additional unit sales, those base odds are multiplied by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). Given this multiplicative effect that \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) has on the odds, it is known as an odds ratio.\n\n# convert log odds to base odds and odds ratio\nexp(sales_model$coefficients)\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n3.488357e-10 1.037442e+00 \n\n\nSo we can see that the base odds of promotion with zero sales is very close to zero, which makes sense. Note that odds can only be precisely zero in a situation where it is impossible to be in the positive class (that is, nobody gets promoted). We can also see that each unit (that is, every $1000) of sales multiplies the base odds by approximately 1.04—in other words, it increases the odds of promotion by 4%.\n\n\n5.2.3 Odds versus probability\nIt is worth spending a little time understanding the concept of odds and how it relates to probability. It is extremely common for these two terms to be used synonymously, and this can lead to serious misunderstandings when interpreting a logistic regression model.\nIf a certain event has a probability of 0.1, then this means that its odds are 1:9, or 0.111. If the probability is 0.5, then the odds are 1, if the probability is 0.9, then the odds are 9, and if the probability is 0.99, the odds are 99. As we approach a probability of 1, the odds become exponentially large, as illustrated in Figure 5.3 (c)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Odds plotted against probability\n\n\n\nThe consequence of this is that a given increase in odds can have a different effect on probability depending on what the original probability was in the first place. If the probability was already quite low, for example 0.1, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 0.116, which translates to a new probability of 0.103586, representing an increase in probability of 3.59%, which is very close to the increase in odds. If the probability was already high, say 0.9, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 9.36, which translates to a new probability of 0.903475 representing an increase in probability of 0.39%, which is very different from the increase in odds. Figure 5.3 (d) shows the impact of a 4% increase in odds according to the original probability of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Effect of 4% increase in odds plotted against original probability\n\n\n\nWe can see that the closer the base probability is to zero, the similar the effect of the increase on both odds and on probability. However, the higher the probability of the event, the less impact the increase in odds has. In any case, it’s useful to remember the formulas for converting odds to probability and vice versa. If \\(O\\) represents odds and \\(P\\) represents probability then we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nO &= \\frac{P}{1 - P} \\\\\nP &= \\frac{O}{1 + O}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n5.3 Running a multiple binomial logistic regression model\nThe derivations in the previous section extend to multivariable data. Let \\(y\\) be a dichotomous outcome, and let \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\) be our input variables. Then\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n\\] for coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\). As before:\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) represents the log odds of our outcome when all inputs are zero\nEach \\(\\beta_i\\) represents the increase in the log odds of our outcome associated with a unit change in \\(x_i\\), assuming no change in other inputs.\n\nApplying an exponent as before, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^{x_1}(e^{\\beta_2})^{x_2}\\dots(e^{\\beta_p})^{x_p}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore we can conclude that:\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the odds of the outcome when all inputs are zero.\nEach \\(e^{\\beta_i}\\) represents the odds ratio associated with a unit increase in \\(x_i\\) assuming no change in the other inputs (that is, a unit increase in \\(x_i\\) multiplies the odds of our outcome by \\(e^{\\beta_i}\\)).\n\nLet’s put this into practice.\n\n5.3.1 Running and interpreting a multiple binomial logistic regression model\nLet’s use a binomial logistic regression model to understand how each of the three inputs in our salespeople data set influence the likelihood of promotion.\nFirst, as we learned previously, it is good practice to convert the categorical performance variable to a dummy variable5.\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n\n# convert performance to dummy\nsalespeople_dummies &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(salespeople)\n\n# check it worked\nhead(salespeople_dummies)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance_2 performance_3 performance_4\n1        0   594          3.94             1             0             0\n2        0   446          4.06             0             1             0\n3        1   674          3.83             0             0             1\n4        0   525          3.62             1             0             0\n5        1   657          4.40             0             1             0\n6        1   918          4.54             1             0             0\n\n\nNow we can run our model (using the formula promoted ~ . to mean regressing promoted against everything else) and view our coefficients.\n\n# run binomial glm\nfull_model &lt;- glm(formula = \"promoted ~ .\",\n                  family = \"binomial\",\n                  data = salespeople_dummies)\n\n# get coefficient summary \n(coefs &lt;- summary(full_model)$coefficients)\n\n                  Estimate  Std.

This is because everyone is in one of the four performance categories, so the model is using performance_1 as the reference case. We can interpret each performance coefficient as the effect of a move to that performance category from performance_1.\nWe can already see from the last column of our coefficient summary—the coefficient p-values—that only sales and customer_rate meet the significance threshold of less than 0.05. Interestingly, it appears from the Estimate column that customer_rate has a negative effect on the log odds of promotion. For convenience, we can add an extra column to our coefficient summary to create the exponents of our estimated coefficients so that we can see the odds ratios. We can also remove columns that are less useful to us if we wish.\n\n# create coefficient table with estimates, p-values and odds ratios\n(full_coefs &lt;- cbind(coefs[ ,c(\"Estimate\", \"Pr(&gt;|z|)\")], \n                     odds_ratio = exp(full_model$coefficients))) \n\n                  Estimate     Pr(&gt;|z|)   odds_ratio\n(Intercept)   -19.85893195 8.112287e-09 2.373425e-09\nsales           0.04012425 1.052611e-09 1.040940e+00\ncustomer_rate  -1.11213130 2.121881e-02 3.288573e-01\nperformance_2   0.26299953 7.969139e-01 1.300826e+00\nperformance_3   0.68495453 4.855581e-01 1.983682e+00\nperformance_4   0.73449340 4.932272e-01 2.084426e+00\n\n\nNow we can interpret our model as follows:\n\nAll else being equal, sales have a significant positive effect on the likelihood of promotion, with each additional thousand dollars of sales increasing the odds of promotion by 4%\nAll else being equal, customer ratings have a significant negative effect on the likelihood of promotion, with one full rating higher associated with 67% lower odds of promotion\nAll else being equal, performance ratings have no significant effect on the likelihood of promotion\n\nThe second conclusion may appear counter-intuitive, but remember from our pairplot in Section 5.1.3 that there is already moderate correlation between sales and customer ratings, and this model will be controlling for that relationship. Recall that our odds ratios act assuming all other variables are the same. Therefore, if two individuals have the same sales and performance ratings, the one with the lower customer rating is more likely to have been promoted. Similarly, if two individuals have the same level of sales and the same customer rating, their performance rating will have no significant bearing on the likelihood of promotion.\nMany analysts will feel uncomfortable with stating these conclusions with too much precision, and therefore exponent confidence intervals can be calculated to provide a range for the odds ratios.\n\nexp(confint(full_model))\n\n                     2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept)   7.879943e-13 7.385387e-07\nsales         1.029762e+00 1.057214e+00\ncustomer_rate 1.141645e-01 7.793018e-01\nperformance_2 1.800447e-01 1.061602e+01\nperformance_3 3.060299e-01 1.547188e+01\nperformance_4 2.614852e-01 1.870827e+01\n\n\nTherefore we can say that—all else being equal—every additional unit of sales increases the odds of promotion by between 3.0% and 5.7%, and every additional point in customer rating decreases the odds of promotion by between 22% and 89%.\nSimilar to other regression models, the unit scale needs to be taken into consideration during interpretation. On first sight, a decrease of up to 89% in odds seems a lot more important than an increase of up to 5.7% in odds. However, the increase of up to 5.7% is for one unit ($1000) in many thousands of sales units, and over 10 or 100 additional units can have a substantial compound effect on odds of promotion. The decrease of up to 89% is on a full customer rating point on a scale of only 4 full points.\n\n\n5.3.2 Understanding the fit and goodness-of-fit of a binomial logistic regression model\nUnderstanding the fit of a binomial logistic regression model is not straightforward and is sometimes controversial. Before we discuss this, let’s simplify our model based on our learning that the performance data has no significant effect on the outcome.\n\n# simplify model\nsimpler_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate,\n                     family = \"binomial\",\n                     data = salespeople)\n\nAs in the previous chapter, again we have the luxury of a three-dimensional model, so we can visualize it in Figure 5.3 (b), revealing a 3D sigmoid curve which ‘twists’ to reflect the relative influence of sales and customer_rate on the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 3D visualization of the fitted simpler_model against the salespeople data\n\n\nNow let’s look at the summary of our simpler_model.\n\nsummary(simpler_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = salespeople)\n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

The main reason for this is that there is no clear unified point of view in the statistics community on a single appropriate measure for model fit in the case of logistic regression. Nevertheless, a number of options are available to analysts for estimating fit and goodness-of-fit for these models.\nPseudo-\\(R^2\\) measures are attempts to estimate the amount of variance in the outcome that is explained by the fitted model, analogous to the \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. There are numerous variants of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) with some of the most common listed here:\n\nMcFadden’s \\(R^2\\) works by comparing the likelihood function of the fitted model with that of a random model and using this to estimate the explained variance in the outcome.\nCox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) works by applying a ‘sum of squares’ analogy to the likelihood functions to align more closely with the precise methodology for calculating \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. However, this usually means that the maximum value is less than 1 and in certain circumstances substantially less than 1, which can be problematic and unintuitive for an \\(R^2\\).\nNagelkerke’s \\(R^2\\) resolves the issue with the upper bound for Cox and Snell by dividing Cox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) by its upper bound. This restores an intuitive scale with a maximum of 1, but is considered somewhat arbitrary with limited theoretical foundation.\nTjur’s \\(R^2\\) is a more recent and simpler concept. It is defined as simply the absolute difference between the predicted probabilities of the positive observations and those of the negative observations.\n\nStandard modeling functions generally do not offer the calculation of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) as standard, but numerous methods are available for their calculation. For example:\n\nlibrary(DescTools)\nDescTools::PseudoR2(\n  simpler_model, \n  which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\", \"Tjur\")\n)\n\n  McFadden   CoxSnell Nagelkerke       Tjur \n 0.8520759  0.6576490  0.9187858  0.8784834 \n\n\nWe see that the Cox and Snell variant is notably lower than the other estimates, which is consistent with the known issues with its upper bound. However, the other estimates are reasonably aligned and suggest a strong fit.\nGoodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models compare the predictions to the observed outcome and test the null hypothesis that they are similar. This means that, unlike in linear regression, a low p-value indicates a poor fit. One commonly used method is the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which divides the observations into a number of groups (usually 10) according to their fitted probabilities, calculates the proportion of each group that is positive and then compares this to the expected proportions based on the model prediction using a Chi-squared test. However, this method has limitations. It is particularly problematic for situations where there is a low sample size and can return highly varied results based on the number of groups used. It is therefore recommended to use a range of goodness-of-fit tests, and not rely entirely on any one specific approach.\nIn R, the generalhoslem package can perform the popular Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness of fit for logistic regression models, and is recommended for exploration. Here is an example using the logitgof() function for assessing goodness-of-fit, which uses 10 groups as default.\n\nlibrary(generalhoslem)\n\n# run Hosmer-Lemeshow GOF test on observed versus fitted values\nsimpler_model_diagnostics &lt;- generalhoslem::logitgof(\n  salespeople$promoted, \n  fitted(simpler_model) \n)\n\n# view results\nsimpler_model_diagnostics\n\n\n    Hosmer and Lemeshow test (binary model)\n\ndata:  salespeople$promoted, fitted(simpler_model)\nX-squared = 3.4458, df = 8, p-value = 0.9034\n\n\nThe non-significant result of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests a good fit for our model.\nVarious measures of predictive accuracy can also be used to assess a binomial logistic regression model in a predictive context, such as precision, recall and ROC-curve analysis. These are particularly suited for implementations of logistic regression models as predictive classifiers in a Machine Learning context, a topic which is outside the scope of this book. However, a recommended source for a deeper treatment of goodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models is Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013).\n\n\n5.3.3 Model parsimony\nWe saw that in both our linear regression and our logistic regression approach, we decided to drop variables from our model when we determined that they had no significant effect on the outcome. The principle of Occam’s Razor states that—all else being equal—the simplest explanation is the best. In this sense, a model that contains information that does not contribute to its primary inference objective is more complex than it needs to be. Such a model increases the communication burden in explaining its results to others, with no notable analytic benefit in return.\nParsimony describes the concept of being careful with resources or with information. A model could be described as more parsimonious if it can achieve the same (or very close to the same) fit with a smaller number of inputs. The Akaike Information Criterion or AIC is a measure of model parsimony that is computed for log-likelihood models like logistic regression models, with a lower AIC indicating a more parsimonious model. AIC is often calculated as standard in summary reports of logistic regression models but can also be calculated independently. Let’s compare the different iterations of our model in this chapter using AIC.\n\n# sales only model\nAIC(sales_model)\n\n[1] 76.49508\n\n# sales and customer rating model\nAIC(simpler_model)\n\n[1] 71.13145\n\n# model with all inputs\nAIC(full_model)\n\n[1] 76.37433\n\n\nWe can see that the model which is limited to our two significant inputs—sales and customer rating—is determined to be the most parsimonious model according to the AIC. Note that the AIC should not be used to interpret model quality or confidence—it is possible that the lowest AIC might still be a very poor fit.\nModel parsimony becomes a substantial concern when there is a large number of input variables. As a general rule, the more input variables there are in a model the greater the chance that the model will be difficult to interpret clearly, and the greater the risk of measurement problems, such as multicollinearity. Analysts who are eager to please their customers, clients, professors or bosses can easily be tempted to think up new potential inputs to their model, often derived mathematically from measures that are already inputs in the model. Before long the model is too complex, and in extreme cases there are more inputs than there are observations. The primary way to manage model complexity is to exercise caution in selecting model inputs. When large numbers of inputs are unavoidable, coefficient regularization methods such as LASSO regression can help with model parsimony.\n\n\n\n5.4 Other considerations in binomial logistic regression\nTo predict from new data, just use the predict() function as in the previous chapter. This function recognizes the type of model being used—in this case a generalized linear model—and adjusts its prediction approach accordingly. In particular, if you want to return the probability of the new observations being promoted, you need to use type = \"response\" as an argument.\n\n# define new observations\n(new_data &lt;- data.frame(sales = c(420, 510, 710), \n                        customer_rate = c(3.4, 2.3, 4.2)))\n\n  sales customer_rate\n1   420           3.4\n2   510           2.3\n3   710           4.2\n\n# predict probability of promotion\npredict(simpler_model, new_data, type = \"response\")\n\n         1          2          3 \n0.00171007 0.18238565 0.98840506 \n\n\nMany of the principles covered in the previous chapter on linear regression are equally important in logistic regression. For example, input variables should be managed in a similar way. Collinearity and multicollinearity should be of concern. Interaction of input variables can be modeled. For the most part, analysts should be aware of the fundamental mathematical transformations which take place in a logistic regression model when they consider some of these issues (another reason to ensure that the mathematics covered earlier in this chapter is well understood). For example, while coefficients in linear regression have a direct additive impact on \\(y\\), in logistic regression they have a direct additive impact on the log odds of \\(y\\), or alternatively their exponents have a direct multiplicative impact on the odds of \\(y\\). Therefore coefficient overestimation such as that which can occur when collinearity is not managed can result in inferences that could substantially overstate the importance or effect of input variables.\nBecause of the binary nature of our outcome variable, the residuals of a logistic regression model have limited direct application to the problem being studied. In practical contexts the residuals of logistic regression models are rarely examined, but they can be useful in identifying outliers or particularly influential observations and in assessing goodness-of-fit. When residuals are examined, they need to be transformed in order to be analyzed appropriately. For example, the Pearson residual is a standardized form of residual from logistic regression which can be expected to have a normal distribution over large-enough samples. We can see in Figure 5.3 (c) that this is the case for our simpler_model, but that there are a small number of substantial underestimates in our model. A good source of further learning on diagnostics of logistic regression models is Menard (2010).\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- density(residuals(simpler_model, \"pearson\"))\nplot(d, main= \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Distribution of Pearson residuals in simpler_model\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Binomial logistic regression using Python\nIn Python, binomial logistic regression models can be generated in a similar way to OLS linear regression models using the statsmodels formula API, calling the binomial family from the general statsmodels API.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# obtain salespeople data\nurl = \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv\"\nsalespeople = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n# define model\nmodel = smf.glm(formula = \"promoted ~ sales + customer_rate\", \n                data = salespeople, \n                family = sm.families.Binomial())\n\n\n# fit model\npromotion_model = model.fit()\n\n\n# see results summary\nprint(promotion_model.summary())\n\n                 Generalized Linear Model Regression Results                  \n==============================================================================\nDep.

    "text": "Imagine that you have an outcome event \\(y\\) which either occurs or does not occur. The probability of \\(y\\) occurring, or \\(P(y = 1)\\), obviously takes a value between 0 and 1. Now imagine that some input variable \\(x\\) has a positive effect on the probability of the event occurring. Then you would naturally expect \\(P(y = 1)\\) to increase as \\(x\\) increases.\nIn our salespeople data set, let’s plot our promotion outcome against the sales input. This can be seen in Figure 5.3 (a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plot of promotion against sales in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that promotion is more likely with higher sales levels. As we move along the \\(x\\) axis from left to right and gradually include more and more individuals with higher sales, we know that the probability of promotion is gradually increasing overall. We could try to model this probability using our logistic function, which we learned about in Section 5.1.1. For example, let’s plot the logistic function \\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_{0})}}\n\\]\non this data, where we set \\(x_0\\) to the mean of sales and \\(k\\) to be some maximum gradient value. In Figure 5.3 (b) we can see these logistic functions for different values of \\(k\\). All of these seem to reflect the pattern we are observing to some extent, but how do we determine the best-fitting logistic function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Overlaying logistic functions with various gradients onto previous plot\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Deriving the concept of log odds\nLet’s look more carefully at the index of the exponential constant \\(e\\) in the denominator of our logistic function. Note that, because \\(x_{0}\\) is a constant, we have:\n\\[\n-k(x - x_{0}) = -(-kx_{0} + kx) = -(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_1x)\n\\] where \\(\\beta_0 = -kx_0\\) and \\(\\beta_{1} = k\\). Therefore,\n\\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\]\nThis equation makes intuitive sense. As the value of \\(x\\) increases, the value \\(e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}\\) gets smaller and smaller towards zero, and thus \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches its theoretical maximum value of 1. As the value of \\(x\\) decreases towards zero, we see that the value of \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches a minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta_0}}\\). Referring back to our salespeople example, we can thus see that \\(\\beta_0\\) helps determine the baseline probability of promotion assuming no sales at all. If \\(\\beta_0\\) has an extremely negative value, this baseline probability will approach its theoretical minimum of zero.\nLet’s formalize the role of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in the likelihood of a positive outcome. We know that for any binary event \\(y\\), \\(P(y = 0)\\) is equal to \\(1 - P(y = 1)\\), so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(y = 0) &= 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)} - 1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPutting these together, we find that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}}{\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nor alternatively, if we apply the natural logarithm to both sides\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\n\\]\nThe right-hand side should look familiar from the previous chapter on linear regression, meaning there is something here we can model linearly. But what is the left-hand side?\n\\(P(y = 1)\\) is the probability that the event will occur, while \\(P(y = 0)\\) is the probability that the event will not occur. You may be familiar from sports like horse racing or other gambling situations that the ratio of these two represents the odds of an event. For example, if a given horse has odds of 1:4, this means that there is a 20% probability they will win and an 80% probability they will not3.\nTherefore we can conclude that the natural logarithm of the odds of \\(y\\)—usually termed the log odds of \\(y\\)—is linear in \\(x\\), and therefore we can model the log odds of \\(y\\) using similar linear regression methods to those studied in Chapter 44.\n\n\n5.2.2 Modeling the log odds and interpreting the coefficients\nLet’s take our simple case of regressing the promoted outcome against sales. We use a standard binomial GLM function and our standard formula notation which we learned in the previous chapter.\n\n# run a binomial model \nsales_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales, \n                   data = salespeople, family = \"binomial\")\n\n# view the coefficients\nsales_model$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n-21.77642020   0.03675848 \n\n\nWe can interpret the coefficients as follows:\n\nThe (Intercept) coefficient is the value of the log odds with zero input value of \\(x\\)—it is the log odds of promotion if you made no sales.\nThe sales coefficient represents the increase in the log odds of promotion associated with each unit increase in sales.\n\nWe can convert these coefficients from log odds to odds by applying the exponent function, to return to the identity we had previously\n\\[\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x} = e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^x\n\\]\nFrom this, we can interpret that \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the base odds of promotion assuming no sales, and that for every additional unit sales, those base odds are multiplied by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). Given this multiplicative effect that \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) has on the odds, it is known as an odds ratio.\n\n# convert log odds to base odds and odds ratio\nexp(sales_model$coefficients)\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n3.488357e-10 1.037442e+00 \n\n\nSo we can see that the base odds of promotion with zero sales is very close to zero, which makes sense. Note that odds can only be precisely zero in a situation where it is impossible to be in the positive class (that is, nobody gets promoted). We can also see that each unit (that is, every $1000) of sales multiplies the base odds by approximately 1.04—in other words, it increases the odds of promotion by 4%.\n\n\n5.2.3 Odds versus probability\nIt is worth spending a little time understanding the concept of odds and how it relates to probability. It is extremely common for these two terms to be used synonymously, and this can lead to serious misunderstandings when interpreting a logistic regression model.\nIf a certain event has a probability of 0.1, then this means that its odds are 1:9, or 0.111. If the probability is 0.5, then the odds are 1, if the probability is 0.9, then the odds are 9, and if the probability is 0.99, the odds are 99. As we approach a probability of 1, the odds become exponentially large, as illustrated in Figure 5.3 (c)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Odds plotted against probability\n\n\n\nThe consequence of this is that a given increase in odds can have a different effect on probability depending on what the original probability was in the first place. If the probability was already quite low, for example 0.1, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 0.116, which translates to a new probability of 0.103586, representing an increase in probability of 3.59%, which is very close to the increase in odds. If the probability was already high, say 0.9, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 9.36, which translates to a new probability of 0.903475 representing an increase in probability of 0.39%, which is very different from the increase in odds. Figure 5.3 (d) shows the impact of a 4% increase in odds according to the original probability of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Effect of 4% increase in odds plotted against original probability\n\n\n\nWe can see that the closer the base probability is to zero, the similar the effect of the increase on both odds and on probability. However, the higher the probability of the event, the less impact the increase in odds has. In any case, it’s useful to remember the formulas for converting odds to probability and vice versa. If \\(O\\) represents odds and \\(P\\) represents probability then we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nO &= \\frac{P}{1 - P} \\\\\nP &= \\frac{O}{1 + O}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

    "text": "5.3 Running a multiple binomial logistic regression model\nThe derivations in the previous section extend to multivariable data. Let \\(y\\) be a dichotomous outcome, and let \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\) be our input variables. Then\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n\\] for coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,\\dots, \\beta_p\\). As before:\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) represents the log odds of our outcome when all inputs are zero\nEach \\(\\beta_i\\) represents the increase in the log odds of our outcome associated with a unit change in \\(x_i\\), assuming no change in other inputs.\n\nApplying an exponent as before, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^{x_1}(e^{\\beta_2})^{x_2}\\dots(e^{\\beta_p})^{x_p}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore we can conclude that:\n\n\\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the odds of the outcome when all inputs are zero.\nEach \\(e^{\\beta_i}\\) represents the odds ratio associated with a unit increase in \\(x_i\\) assuming no change in the other inputs (that is, a unit increase in \\(x_i\\) multiplies the odds of our outcome by \\(e^{\\beta_i}\\)).\n\nLet’s put this into practice.\n\n5.3.1 Running and interpreting a multiple binomial logistic regression model\nLet’s use a binomial logistic regression model to understand how each of the three inputs in our salespeople data set influence the likelihood of promotion.\nFirst, as we learned previously, it is good practice to convert the categorical performance variable to a dummy variable5.\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n\n# convert performance to dummy\nsalespeople_dummies &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(salespeople)\n\n# check it worked\nhead(salespeople_dummies)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance_2 performance_3 performance_4\n1        0   594          3.94             1             0             0\n2        0   446          4.06             0             1             0\n3        1   674          3.83             0             0             1\n4        0   525          3.62             1             0             0\n5        1   657          4.40             0             1             0\n6        1   918          4.54             1             0             0\n\n\nNow we can run our model (using the formula promoted ~ . to mean regressing promoted against everything else) and view our coefficients.\n\n# run binomial glm\nfull_model &lt;- glm(formula = \"promoted ~ .\",\n                  family = \"binomial\",\n                  data = salespeople_dummies)\n\n# get coefficient summary \n(coefs &lt;- summary(full_model)$coefficients)\n\n                  Estimate  Std.

This is because everyone is in one of the four performance categories, so the model is using performance_1 as the reference case. We can interpret each performance coefficient as the effect of a move to that performance category from performance_1.\nWe can already see from the last column of our coefficient summary—the coefficient p-values—that only sales and customer_rate meet the significance threshold of less than 0.05. Interestingly, it appears from the Estimate column that customer_rate has a negative effect on the log odds of promotion. For convenience, we can add an extra column to our coefficient summary to create the exponents of our estimated coefficients so that we can see the odds ratios. We can also remove columns that are less useful to us if we wish.\n\n# create coefficient table with estimates, p-values and odds ratios\n(full_coefs &lt;- cbind(coefs[ ,c(\"Estimate\", \"Pr(&gt;|z|)\")], \n                     odds_ratio = exp(full_model$coefficients))) \n\n                  Estimate     Pr(&gt;|z|)   odds_ratio\n(Intercept)   -19.85893195 8.112287e-09 2.373425e-09\nsales           0.04012425 1.052611e-09 1.040940e+00\ncustomer_rate  -1.11213130 2.121881e-02 3.288573e-01\nperformance_2   0.26299953 7.969139e-01 1.300826e+00\nperformance_3   0.68495453 4.855581e-01 1.983682e+00\nperformance_4   0.73449340 4.932272e-01 2.084426e+00\n\n\nNow we can interpret our model as follows:\n\nAll else being equal, sales have a significant positive effect on the likelihood of promotion, with each additional thousand dollars of sales increasing the odds of promotion by 4%\nAll else being equal, customer ratings have a significant negative effect on the likelihood of promotion, with one full rating higher associated with 67% lower odds of promotion\nAll else being equal, performance ratings have no significant effect on the likelihood of promotion\n\nThe second conclusion may appear counter-intuitive, but remember from our pairplot in Section 5.1.3 that there is already moderate correlation between sales and customer ratings, and this model will be controlling for that relationship. Recall that our odds ratios act assuming all other variables are the same. Therefore, if two individuals have the same sales and performance ratings, the one with the lower customer rating is more likely to have been promoted. Similarly, if two individuals have the same level of sales and the same customer rating, their performance rating will have no significant bearing on the likelihood of promotion.\nMany analysts will feel uncomfortable with stating these conclusions with too much precision, and therefore exponent confidence intervals can be calculated to provide a range for the odds ratios.\n\nexp(confint(full_model))\n\n                     2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept)   7.879943e-13 7.385387e-07\nsales         1.029762e+00 1.057214e+00\ncustomer_rate 1.141645e-01 7.793018e-01\nperformance_2 1.800447e-01 1.061602e+01\nperformance_3 3.060299e-01 1.547188e+01\nperformance_4 2.614852e-01 1.870827e+01\n\n\nTherefore we can say that—all else being equal—every additional unit of sales increases the odds of promotion by between 3.0% and 5.7%, and every additional point in customer rating decreases the odds of promotion by between 22% and 89%.\nSimilar to other regression models, the unit scale needs to be taken into consideration during interpretation. On first sight, a decrease of up to 89% in odds seems a lot more important than an increase of up to 5.7% in odds. However, the increase of up to 5.7% is for one unit ($1000) in many thousands of sales units, and over 10 or 100 additional units can have a substantial compound effect on odds of promotion. The decrease of up to 89% is on a full customer rating point on a scale of only 4 full points.\n\n\n5.3.2 Understanding the fit and goodness-of-fit of a binomial logistic regression model\nUnderstanding the fit of a binomial logistic regression model is not straightforward and is sometimes controversial. Before we discuss this, let’s simplify our model based on our learning that the performance data has no significant effect on the outcome.\n\n# simplify model\nsimpler_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate,\n                     family = \"binomial\",\n                     data = salespeople)\n\nAs in the previous chapter, again we have the luxury of a three-dimensional model, so we can visualize it in Figure 5.3 (b), revealing a 3D sigmoid curve which ‘twists’ to reflect the relative influence of sales and customer_rate on the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 3D visualization of the fitted simpler_model against the salespeople data\n\n\nNow let’s look at the summary of our simpler_model.\n\nsummary(simpler_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = salespeople)\n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

The main reason for this is that there is no clear unified point of view in the statistics community on a single appropriate measure for model fit in the case of logistic regression. Nevertheless, a number of options are available to analysts for estimating fit and goodness-of-fit for these models.\nPseudo-\\(R^2\\) measures are attempts to estimate the amount of variance in the outcome that is explained by the fitted model, analogous to the \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. There are numerous variants of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) with some of the most common listed here:\n\nMcFadden’s \\(R^2\\) works by comparing the likelihood function of the fitted model with that of a random model and using this to estimate the explained variance in the outcome.\nCox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) works by applying a ‘sum of squares’ analogy to the likelihood functions to align more closely with the precise methodology for calculating \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. However, this usually means that the maximum value is less than 1 and in certain circumstances substantially less than 1, which can be problematic and unintuitive for an \\(R^2\\).\nNagelkerke’s \\(R^2\\) resolves the issue with the upper bound for Cox and Snell by dividing Cox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) by its upper bound. This restores an intuitive scale with a maximum of 1, but is considered somewhat arbitrary with limited theoretical foundation.\nTjur’s \\(R^2\\) is a more recent and simpler concept. It is defined as simply the absolute difference between the predicted probabilities of the positive observations and those of the negative observations.\n\nStandard modeling functions generally do not offer the calculation of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) as standard, but numerous methods are available for their calculation. For example:\n\nlibrary(DescTools)\nDescTools::PseudoR2(\n  simpler_model, \n  which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\", \"Tjur\")\n)\n\n  McFadden   CoxSnell Nagelkerke       Tjur \n 0.8520759  0.6576490  0.9187858  0.8784834 \n\n\nWe see that the Cox and Snell variant is notably lower than the other estimates, which is consistent with the known issues with its upper bound. However, the other estimates are reasonably aligned and suggest a strong fit.\nGoodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models compare the predictions to the observed outcome and test the null hypothesis that they are similar. This means that, unlike in linear regression, a low p-value indicates a poor fit. One commonly used method is the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which divides the observations into a number of groups (usually 10) according to their fitted probabilities, calculates the proportion of each group that is positive and then compares this to the expected proportions based on the model prediction using a Chi-squared test. However, this method has limitations. It is particularly problematic for situations where there is a low sample size and can return highly varied results based on the number of groups used. It is therefore recommended to use a range of goodness-of-fit tests, and not rely entirely on any one specific approach.\nIn R, the generalhoslem package can perform the popular Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness of fit for logistic regression models, and is recommended for exploration. Here is an example using the logitgof() function for assessing goodness-of-fit, which uses 10 groups as default.\n\nlibrary(generalhoslem)\n\n# run Hosmer-Lemeshow GOF test on observed versus fitted values\nsimpler_model_diagnostics &lt;- generalhoslem::logitgof(\n  salespeople$promoted, \n  fitted(simpler_model) \n)\n\n# view results\nsimpler_model_diagnostics\n\n\n    Hosmer and Lemeshow test (binary model)\n\ndata:  salespeople$promoted, fitted(simpler_model)\nX-squared = 3.4458, df = 8, p-value = 0.9034\n\n\nThe non-significant result of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests a good fit for our model.\nVarious measures of predictive accuracy can also be used to assess a binomial logistic regression model in a predictive context, such as precision, recall and ROC-curve analysis. These are particularly suited for implementations of logistic regression models as predictive classifiers in a Machine Learning context, a topic which is outside the scope of this book. However, a recommended source for a deeper treatment of goodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models is Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013).\n\n\n5.3.3 Model parsimony\nWe saw that in both our linear regression and our logistic regression approach, we decided to drop variables from our model when we determined that they had no significant effect on the outcome. The principle of Occam’s Razor states that—all else being equal—the simplest explanation is the best. In this sense, a model that contains information that does not contribute to its primary inference objective is more complex than it needs to be. Such a model increases the communication burden in explaining its results to others, with no notable analytic benefit in return.\nParsimony describes the concept of being careful with resources or with information. A model could be described as more parsimonious if it can achieve the same (or very close to the same) fit with a smaller number of inputs. The Akaike Information Criterion or AIC is a measure of model parsimony that is computed for log-likelihood models like logistic regression models, with a lower AIC indicating a more parsimonious model. AIC is often calculated as standard in summary reports of logistic regression models but can also be calculated independently. Let’s compare the different iterations of our model in this chapter using AIC.\n\n# sales only model\nAIC(sales_model)\n\n[1] 76.49508\n\n# sales and customer rating model\nAIC(simpler_model)\n\n[1] 71.13145\n\n# model with all inputs\nAIC(full_model)\n\n[1] 76.37433\n\n\nWe can see that the model which is limited to our two significant inputs—sales and customer rating—is determined to be the most parsimonious model according to the AIC. Note that the AIC should not be used to interpret model quality or confidence—it is possible that the lowest AIC might still be a very poor fit.\nModel parsimony becomes a substantial concern when there is a large number of input variables. As a general rule, the more input variables there are in a model the greater the chance that the model will be difficult to interpret clearly, and the greater the risk of measurement problems, such as multicollinearity. Analysts who are eager to please their customers, clients, professors or bosses can easily be tempted to think up new potential inputs to their model, often derived mathematically from measures that are already inputs in the model. Before long the model is too complex, and in extreme cases there are more inputs than there are observations. The primary way to manage model complexity is to exercise caution in selecting model inputs. When large numbers of inputs are unavoidable, coefficient regularization methods such as LASSO regression can help with model parsimony.",

    "text": "5.4 Other considerations in binomial logistic regression\nTo predict from new data, just use the predict() function as in the previous chapter. This function recognizes the type of model being used—in this case a generalized linear model—and adjusts its prediction approach accordingly. In particular, if you want to return the probability of the new observations being promoted, you need to use type = \"response\" as an argument.\n\n# define new observations\n(new_data &lt;- data.frame(sales = c(420, 510, 710), \n                        customer_rate = c(3.4, 2.3, 4.2)))\n\n  sales customer_rate\n1   420           3.4\n2   510           2.3\n3   710           4.2\n\n# predict probability of promotion\npredict(simpler_model, new_data, type = \"response\")\n\n         1          2          3 \n0.00171007 0.18238565 0.98840506 \n\n\nMany of the principles covered in the previous chapter on linear regression are equally important in logistic regression. For example, input variables should be managed in a similar way. Collinearity and multicollinearity should be of concern. Interaction of input variables can be modeled. For the most part, analysts should be aware of the fundamental mathematical transformations which take place in a logistic regression model when they consider some of these issues (another reason to ensure that the mathematics covered earlier in this chapter is well understood). For example, while coefficients in linear regression have a direct additive impact on \\(y\\), in logistic regression they have a direct additive impact on the log odds of \\(y\\), or alternatively their exponents have a direct multiplicative impact on the odds of \\(y\\). Therefore coefficient overestimation such as that which can occur when collinearity is not managed can result in inferences that could substantially overstate the importance or effect of input variables.\nBecause of the binary nature of our outcome variable, the residuals of a logistic regression model have limited direct application to the problem being studied. In practical contexts the residuals of logistic regression models are rarely examined, but they can be useful in identifying outliers or particularly influential observations and in assessing goodness-of-fit. When residuals are examined, they need to be transformed in order to be analyzed appropriately. For example, the Pearson residual is a standardized form of residual from logistic regression which can be expected to have a normal distribution over large-enough samples. We can see in Figure 5.3 (c) that this is the case for our simpler_model, but that there are a small number of substantial underestimates in our model. A good source of further learning on diagnostics of logistic regression models is Menard (2010).\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- density(residuals(simpler_model, \"pearson\"))\nplot(d, main= \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Distribution of Pearson residuals in simpler_model",

    "text": "6.1.1 Intuition for multinomial logistic regression\nA binary or dichotomous outcome like we studied in the previous chapter is already in fact a nominal outcome with two categories, so in principle we already have the basic technology with which to study this problem. That said, the way we approach the problem can differ according to the types of inferences we wish to make.\nIf we only wish to make inferences about the choice of each specific category—what drives whether an observation is in Category A versus the others, or Category B versus the others—then we have the option of running separate binomial logistic regression models on a ‘one versus the rest’ basis. In this case we can refine our model differently for each category, eliminating variables that are not significant in determining membership of that category. This could potentially lead to models being defined differently for different target outcome categories. Notably, there will be no common comparison category between these models. This is sometimes called a stratified approach.\nHowever, in many studies there is a need for a ‘reference’ category to better understand the relative odds of category membership. For example, in clinical settings the relative risk factors for different clinical outcomes can only be understood relative to a reference (usually that of the ‘most healthy’ or ‘most recovered’ patients)1. In organizational settings, one can imagine that the odds of different types of mid-tenure career path changes could only be well understood relative to a reference career path (probably the most common one). While this approach would still be founded on binomial models, the reference points of these models are different; we would need to make decisions on refining the model differently, and we interpret the coefficients in a different way.\nIn this chapter we will briefly look at the stratified approach (which is effectively a repetition of work done in the previous chapter) before focusing more intently on how we construct models and make inferences using a multinomial approach.\n\n\n6.1.2 Use cases for multinomial logistic regression\nMultinomial logistic regression is appropriate for any situation where a limited number of outcome categories (more than two) are being modeled and where those outcome categories have no order. An underlying assumption is the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Otherwise stated, this assumption means that there is no other alternative for the outcome that, if included, would disproportionately influence the membership of one of the other categories2. In cases where this assumption is violated, one could choose to take a stratified approach, or attempt hierarchical or nested multinomial model alternatives, which are beyond the scope of this book.\nExamples of typical situations that might be modeled by multinomial logistic regression include:\n\nModeling voting choice in elections with multiple candidates\nModeling choice of career options by students\nModeling choice of benefit options by employees\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst at a large technology company. The company recently introduced a new health insurance provider for its employees. At the beginning of the year the employees had to choose one of three different health plan products from this provider to best suit their needs. You have been asked to determine which factors influenced the choice in product.\nThe health_insurance data set consists of the following fields:\n\nproduct: The choice of product of the individual—A, B or C\nage: The age of the individual when they made the choice\ngender: The gender of the individual as stated when they made the choice\nhousehold: The number of people living with the individual in the same household at the time of the choice\nposition_level: Position level in the company at the time they made the choice, where 1 is is the lowest and 5 is the highest\nabsent: The number of days the individual was absent from work in the year prior to the choice\n\nFirst we load the data and take a look at it briefly.\n\n# if needed, download health_insurance data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/health_insurance.csv\"\nhealth_insurance &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# view first few rows\nhead(health_insurance)\n\n  product age household position_level gender absent\n1       C  57         2              2   Male     10\n2       A  21         7              2   Male      7\n3       C  66         7              2   Male      1\n4       A  36         4              2 Female      6\n5       A  23         0              2   Male     11\n6       A  31         5              1   Male     14\n\n\n\n# view structure\nstr(health_insurance)\n\n'data.frame':   1453 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ product       : chr  \"C\" \"A\" \"C\" \"A\" ...\n $ age           : int  57 21 66 36 23 31 37 37 55 66 ...\n $ household     : int  2 7 7 4 0 5 3 0 3 2 ...\n $ position_level: int  2 2 2 2 2 1 3 3 3 4 ...\n $ gender        : chr  \"Male\" \"Male\" \"Male\" \"Female\" ...\n $ absent        : int  10 7 1 6 11 14 12 25 3 18 ...\n\n\nIt looks like two of these columns should be converted to factor—product and gender—so let’s do that and then run a pairplot for a quick overview of any patterns, which can be seen in Figure 6.1.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# convert product and gender to factors\nhealth_insurance$product &lt;- as.factor(health_insurance$product)\nhealth_insurance$gender &lt;- as.factor(health_insurance$gender)\n\nGGally::ggpairs(health_insurance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Pairplot of the health_insurance data set\n\n\n\nThe data appears somewhat chaotic here. However, there are a few things to note. Firstly, we notice that there is a relatively even spread in choice between the products. We also notice that age seems to be playing a role in product choice. There are also some mild-to-moderate correlations in the data—in particular between age and position_level, and between absent and position_level. However, this problem is clearly more complex than we can determine from a bivariate perspective.",

    "text": "6.2 Running stratified binomial models\nOne approach to this problem is to look at each product choice and treat it as an independent binomial logistic regression model, modeling that choice against an alternative of all other choices. Each such model may help us describe the dynamics of the choice of a specific product, but we have to be careful in making conclusions about the overall choice between the three products. Running stratified models would not be very efficient if we had a wider range of choices for our outcome, but since we only have three possible choices here, it is reasonable to take this route.\n\n6.2.1 Modeling the choice of Product A versus other products\nLet’s first create and refine a binomial model for the choice of Product A.\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n\n# create dummies for product choice outcome\ndummy_product &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(health_insurance, \n                                          col = \"product\",\n                                          basal_level = TRUE)\n\n# combine to original set\nhealth_insurance &lt;- cbind(health_insurance, dummy_product)\n\n# run a binomial model for the Product A dummy against \n# all input variables (let glm() handle dummy input variables)\nA_model &lt;- glm(\n  formula = product_A ~ age + gender + household + \n    position_level + absent, \n  data = health_insurance, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n\n# summary\nsummary(A_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = product_A ~ age + gender + household + position_level + \n    absent, family = \"binomial\", data = health_insurance)\n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

All else being equal, being older makes the choice of Product A less likely. Males are more likely to choose Product A, and larger households and higher position levels also make the choice of Product A more likely. Based on this, we can consider simplifying our model to remove absent. We can also calculate odds ratios and perform some model diagnostics if we wish, similar to how we approached the problem in the previous chapter.\nThese results need to be interpreted carefully. For example, the odds ratios for the Product A choice based on a simplified model are as follows:\n\n# simpler model\nA_simple &lt;- glm(\n  formula = product_A ~ age + household + gender + position_level, \n  data = health_insurance,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# view odds ratio as a data frame\nas.data.frame(exp(A_simple$coefficients))\n\n                 exp(A_simple$coefficients)\n(Intercept)                     343.4406669\nage                               0.7868098\nhousehold                         1.2711317\ngenderMale                        2.3282637\ngenderNon-binary                  1.2794288\nposition_level                    1.3692971\n\n\nAs an example, and as a reminder from our previous chapter, we interpret the odds ratio for age as follows: all else being equal, every additional year of age is associated with an approximately 21% decrease in the odds of choosing Product A over the other products.\n\n\n6.2.2 Modeling other choices\nIn a similar way we can produce two other models, representing the choice of Products B and C. These models produce similar significant variables, except that position_level does not appear to be significant in the choice of Product C. If we simplify all our three models we will have a slightly differently defined model for the choice of Product C versus our models for the other two product choices. However, we can conclude in general that the only input variable that seems to be non-significant across all choices of product is absent.",

    "text": "6.3 Running a multinomial regression model\nAn alternative to running separate binary stratified models is to run a multinomial logistic regression model. A multinomial logistic model will base itself from a defined reference category, and run a generalized linear model on the log-odds of membership of each of the other categories versus the reference category. Due to its extensive use in epidemiology and medicine, this is often known as the relative risk of one category compared to the reference category. Mathematically speaking, if \\(X\\) is the vector of input variables, and \\(y\\) takes the value \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(C\\), with \\(A\\) as the reference, a multinomial logistic regression model will calculate:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = B)}{P(y=A)}\\right) = \\alpha{X}\n\\] and\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=A)}\\right) = \\beta{X}\n\\] for different vectors of coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\n6.3.1 Defining a reference level and running the model\nThe nnet package in R contains a multinom() function for running a multinomial logistic regression model using neural network technology3.

For example, what are the odds ratios of Product C relative to a reference of Product B? One way to do this would be to change the reference and run the model again. Another option is to note that:\n\\[\n\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=B)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y = A)}}{\\frac{P(y=B)}{P(y = A)}}\n= \\frac{e^{\\beta{X}}}{e^{\\alpha{X}}}\n= e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)X}\n\\] Therefore\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=B)}\\right) = (\\beta - \\alpha)X\n\\] This means we can obtain the coefficients of C against the reference of B by simply calculating the difference between the coefficients of C and B against the common reference of A. Let’s do this.\n\n# calculate difference between coefficients and view as column\ncoefs_c_to_b &lt;- summary(multi_model)$coefficients[2, ] - \n   summary(multi_model)$coefficients[1, ]\n\ndata.frame(coefs_c_to_b)\n\n                 coefs_c_to_b\n(Intercept)      -5.625169520\nage               0.026149597\ngenderMale        2.479305168\ngenderNon-binary -1.523905192\nhousehold         1.172080452\nposition_level    0.201719688\nabsent           -0.008412403\n\n\nIf the number of categories in the outcome variable is limited, this can be an efficient way to obtain the model coefficients against various reference points without having to rerun models. However, to determine standard errors and p-values for these coefficients the model will need to be recalculated against the new reference.",

The recommended approach is as follows:\n\nStart with the variable with the least significant p-values in all sets of coefficients—in our case absent would be the obvious first candidate.\nRun the multinomial model without this variable.\nTest that none of the previous coefficients change by more than 20–25%.\nIf there was no such change, safely remove the variable and proceed to the next non-significant variable.\nIf there is such a change, retain the variable and proceed to the next non-significant variable.\nStop when all non-significant variables have been tested.\n\nIn our case, we can compare the coefficients of the model with and without absent included and verify that the changes in the coefficients are not substantial.\n\n# remove absent\nsimpler_multi_model &lt;- multinom(\n  formula = product ~ age + gender + household + position_level,\n  data = health_insurance, \n  model = TRUE\n)\n\n\n# view coefficients with absent\ndata.frame(t(summary(multi_model)$coefficients))\n\n                           B             C\n(Intercept)      -4.60099991 -10.226169428\nage               0.24366447   0.269814063\ngenderMale       -2.38259765   0.096707521\ngenderNon-binary  0.25234087  -1.271564323\nhousehold        -0.96772368   0.204356774\nposition_level   -0.41530400  -0.213584308\nabsent            0.01167603   0.003263631\n\n\n\n# view coefficients without absent\ndata.frame(t(summary(simpler_multi_model)$coefficients))\n\n                          B            C\n(Intercept)      -4.5008999 -10.19269011\nage               0.2433855   0.26976294\ngenderMale       -2.3771342   0.09801281\ngenderNon-binary  0.1712091  -1.29636779\nhousehold        -0.9641956   0.20510806\nposition_level   -0.3912014  -0.20908835\n\n\nWe can see that only genderNon-binary changed substantially, but we note that this is on an extremely small sample size and so will not have any effect on our model4. It therefore appears safe to remove absent. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion is equally valid in multinomial models for evaluating model parsimony. Here we can calculate that the AIC of our model with and without absent is 1517.36 and 1514.25, respectively, confirming that the model without absent is marginally more parsimonious.\n\n\n6.4.2 Model fit and goodness-of-fit\nAs with the binomial case, a variety of Pseudo-\\(R^2\\) methods are available to assess the fit of a multinomial logistic regression model, although some of our previous variants (particularly Tjur) are not defined on models with more than two outcome categories.\n\nDescTools::PseudoR2(simpler_multi_model, \n                    which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\"))\n\n  McFadden   CoxSnell Nagelkerke \n 0.5329175  0.6896945  0.7760413 \n\n\nDue to the fact that multinomial models have more than one set of coefficients, assessing goodness-of-fit is more challenging, and is still an area of intense research. The most approachable method to assess model confidence is the Hosmer-Lemeshow test mentioned in the previous chapter, which was extended in Fagerland, Hosmer, and Bofin (2008) for multinomial models. An implementation is available in the generalhoslem package in R. However, this version of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test is problematic for models with a small number of input variables (fewer than ten), and therefore we will not experiment with it here. For further exploration of this topic, Chapter 8 of Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013) is recommended, and for a more thorough treatment of the entire topic of categorical analytics, Agresti (2007) is an excellent companion.",

    "text": "7.1 When to use it\nOften our outcomes will be categorical in nature, but they will also have an order to them. These are sometimes known as ordinal outcomes. Some very common examples of this include ratings of some form, such as job performance ratings or survey responses on Likert scales. The appropriate modeling approach for these outcome types is ordinal logistic regression. Surprisingly, this approach is frequently not understood or adopted by analysts. Often they treat the outcome as a continuous variable and perform simple linear regression, which can lead to wildly inaccurate inferences. Given the prevalence of ordinal outcomes in people analytics, it would serve analysts well to know how to run ordinal logistic regression models, how to interpret them and how to confirm their validity.\nIn fact, there are numerous known ways to approach the inferential modeling of ordinal outcomes, all of which build on the theory of linear, binomial and multinomial regression which we covered in previous chapters. In this chapter, we will focus on the most commonly adopted approach: proportional odds logistic regression. Proportional odds models (sometimes known as constrained cumulative logistic models) are more attractive than other approaches because of their ease of interpretation but cannot be used blindly without important checking of underlying assumptions.",

    "text": "7.1.1 Intuition for proportional odds logistic regression\nOrdinal outcomes can be considered to be suitable for an approach somewhere ‘between’ linear regression and multinomial regression. In common with linear regression, we can consider our outcome to increase or decrease dependent on our inputs. However, unlike linear regression the increase and decrease is ‘stepwise’ rather than continuous, and we do not know that the difference between the steps is the same across the scale. In medical settings, the difference between moving from healthy to an early-stage disease may not be equivalent to moving from an early-stage disease to an intermediate- or advanced-stage. Equally, it may be a much bigger psychological step for a performance evaluator to give someone a low performance rating than to give them a high performance rating. In this sense, we are analyzing categorical outcomes similar to a multinomial approach.\nTo formalize this intuition, we can imagine a latent version of our outcome variable that takes a continuous form, and where the categories are formed at specific cutoff points on that continuous variable. For example, if our outcome variable \\(y\\) represents job performance on an ordinal scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), we can imagine we are actually dealing with a continuous variable \\(y'\\) along with four increasing ‘cutoff points’ for \\(y'\\) at \\(\\tau_1\\), \\(\\tau_2\\), \\(\\tau_3\\) and \\(\\tau_4\\). We then define each ordinal category as follows: \\(y = 1\\) corresponds to \\(y' \\le \\tau_1\\), \\(y \\le 2\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_2\\), \\(y \\le 3\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_3\\) and \\(y \\le 4\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_4\\). Further, at each such cutoff \\(\\tau_k\\), we assume that the probability \\(P(y' &gt; \\tau_k)\\) takes the form of a logistic function. Therefore, in the proportional odds model, we ‘divide’ the probability space at each level of the outcome variable and consider each as a binomial logistic regression model. For example, at rating 3, we generate a binomial logistic regression model of \\(P(y' &gt; \\tau_3)\\), as illustrated in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Proportional odds model illustration for a 5-point job performance scale outcome greater than 3 on a single input variable. Each cutoff point in the latent continuous outcome variable gives rise to a binomial logistic function.\n\n\n\nThis approach leads to a highly interpretable model that provides a single set of coefficients that are agnostic to the outcome category. For example, we can say that each unit increase in input variable \\(x\\) increases the odds of \\(y\\) being in a higher category by a certain ratio.\n\n\n7.1.2 Use cases for proportional odds logistic regression\nProportional odds logistic regression can be used when there are more than two outcome categories that have an order. An important underlying assumption is that no input variable has a disproportionate effect on a specific level of the outcome variable. This is known as the proportional odds assumption. Referring to Figure 7.1, this assumption means that the ‘slope’ of the logistic function is the same for all category cutoffs1. If this assumption is violated, we cannot reduce the coefficients of the model to a single set across all outcome categories, and this modeling approach fails. Therefore, testing the proportional odds assumption is an important validation step for anyone running this type of model.\nExamples of problems that can utilize a proportional odds logistic regression approach include:\n\nUnderstanding the factors associated with higher ratings in an employee survey on a Likert scale\nUnderstanding the factors associated with higher job performance ratings on an ordinal performance scale\nUnderstanding the factors associated with voting preference in a ranked preference voting system (for example, proportional representation systems)\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst for a sports broadcaster who is doing a feature on player discipline in professional soccer games. To prepare for the feature, you have been asked to verify whether certain metrics are significant in influencing the extent to which a player will be disciplined by the referee for unfair or dangerous play in a game. You have been provided with data on over 2000 different players in different games, and the data contains these fields:\n\ndiscipline: A record of the maximum discipline taken by the referee against the player in the game. ‘None’ means no discipline was taken, ‘Yellow’ means the player was issued a yellow card (warned), ‘Red’ means the player was issued a red card and ordered off the field of play.\nn_yellow_25 is the total number of yellow cards issued to the player in the previous 25 games they played prior to this game.\nn_red_25 is the total number of red cards issued to the player in the previous 25 games they played prior to this game.\nposition is the playing position of the player in the game: ‘D’ is defense (including goalkeeper), ‘M’ is midfield and ‘S’ is striker/attacker.\nlevel is the skill level of the competition in which the game took place, with 1 being higher and 2 being lower.\ncountry is the country in which the game took place—England or Germany.\nresult is the result of the game for the team of the player—‘W’ is win, ‘L’ is lose, ‘D’ is a draw/tie.\n\nLet’s download the soccer data set and take a quick look at it.\n\n# if needed, download data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/soccer.csv\"\nsoccer &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\nhead(soccer)\n\n  discipline n_yellow_25 n_red_25 position result country level\n1       None           4        1        S      D England     1\n2       None           2        2        D      W England     2\n3       None           2        1        M      D England     1\n4       None           2        1        M      L Germany     1\n5       None           2        0        S      W Germany     1\n6       None           3        2        M      W England     1\n\n\nLet’s also take a look at the structure of the data.\n\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : chr  \"None\" \"None\" \"None\" \"None\" ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : chr  \"S\" \"D\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ result     : chr  \"D\" \"W\" \"D\" \"L\" ...\n $ country    : chr  \"England\" \"England\" \"England\" \"Germany\" ...\n $ level      : int  1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe see that there are numerous fields that need to be converted to factors before we can model them. Firstly, our outcome of interest is discipline and this needs to be an ordered factor, which we can choose to increase with the seriousness of the disciplinary action.\n\n# convert discipline to ordered factor\nsoccer$discipline &lt;- ordered(soccer$discipline, \n                             levels = c(\"None\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\"))\n\n# check conversion\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"None\"&lt;\"Yellow\"&lt;..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : chr  \"S\" \"D\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ result     : chr  \"D\" \"W\" \"D\" \"L\" ...\n $ country    : chr  \"England\" \"England\" \"England\" \"Germany\" ...\n $ level      : int  1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe also know that position, country, result and level are categorical, so we convert them to factors. We could in fact choose to convert result and level into ordered factors if we so wish, but this is not necessary for input variables, and the results are usually a little bit easier to read as nominal factors.\n\n# apply as.factor to four columns\ncats &lt;- c(\"position\", \"country\", \"result\", \"level\")\nsoccer[ ,cats] &lt;- lapply(soccer[ ,cats], as.factor)\n\n# check again\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"None\"&lt;\"Yellow\"&lt;..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : Factor w/ 3 levels \"D\",\"M\",\"S\": 3 1 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 1 ...\n $ result     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"D\",\"L\",\"W\": 1 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 1 2 ...\n $ country    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"England\",\"Germany\": 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 ...\n $ level      : Factor w/ 2 levels \"1\",\"2\": 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nNow our data is in a position to run a model. You may wish to conduct some exploratory data analysis at this stage similar to previous chapters, but from this chapter onward we will skip this and focus on the modeling methodology.",

    "text": "7.2 Modeling ordinal outcomes under the assumption of proportional odds\nFor simplicity, and noting that this is easily generalizable, let’s assume that we have an ordinal outcome variable \\(y\\) with three levels similar to our walkthrough example, and that we have one input variable \\(x\\). Let’s call the outcome levels 1, 2 and 3. To follow our intuition from Section 7.1.1, we can model a linear continuous variable \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + E\\), where \\(E\\) is some error with a mean of zero, and two increasing cutoff values \\(\\tau_1\\) and \\(\\tau_2\\). We define \\(y\\) in terms of \\(y'\\) as follows: \\(y = 1\\) if \\(y' \\le \\tau_1\\), \\(y = 2\\) if \\(\\tau_1 &lt; y' \\le \\tau_2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) if \\(y' &gt; \\tau_2\\).\n\n7.2.1 Using a latent continuous outcome variable to derive a proportional odds model\nRecall from Section 4.5.3 that our linear regression approach assumes that our residuals \\(E\\) around our line \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0\\) have a normal distribution. Let’s modify that assumption slightly and instead assume that our residuals take a logistic distribution based on the variance of \\(y'\\). Therefore, \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + \\sigma\\epsilon\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is proportional to the variance of \\(y'\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) follows the shape of a logistic function. That is\n\\[\nP(\\epsilon \\leq z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n\\]\nLet’s look at the probability that our ordinal outcome variable \\(y\\) is in its lowest category.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(y = 1) &= P(y' \\le \\tau_1) \\\\\n&= P(\\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + \\sigma\\epsilon \\leq \\tau_1) \\\\\n&= P(\\epsilon \\leq \\frac{\\tau_1 - \\alpha_1x - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}) \\\\\n&= P(\\epsilon \\le \\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1 = \\frac{\\tau_1 - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}\\) and \\(\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\sigma}\\).\nSince our only values for \\(y\\) are 1, 2 and 3, similar to our derivations in Section 5.2, we conclude that \\(P(y &gt; 1) = 1 - P(y = 1)\\), which calculates to\n\\[\nP(y &gt; 1) = \\frac{e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}\n\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y &gt; 1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}}{\\frac{e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}}\n= e^{\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBy applying the natural logarithm, we conclude that the log odds of \\(y\\) being in our bottom category is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y &gt; 1)}\\right) = \\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}\n\\]\nIn a similar way we can derive the log odds of our ordinal outcome being in our bottom two categories as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y \\leq 2)}{P(y = 3)}\\right) = \\gamma_2 - \\beta{x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\tau_2 - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}\\). One can easily see how this generalizes to an arbitrary number of ordinal categories, where we can state the log odds of being in category \\(k\\) or lower as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y \\leq k)}{P(y &gt; k)}\\right) = \\gamma_k - \\beta{x}\n\\] Alternatively, we can state the log odds of being in a category higher than \\(k\\) by simply inverting the above expression:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y &gt; k)}{P(y \\leq k)}\\right) = -(\\gamma_k - \\beta{x}) = \\beta{x} - \\gamma_k\n\\]\nBy taking exponents we see that the impact of a unit change in \\(x\\) on the odds of \\(y\\) being in a higher ordinal category is \\(\\beta\\), irrespective of what category we are looking at. Therefore we have a single coefficient to explain the effect of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\) throughout the ordinal scale. Note that there are still different intercept coefficients \\(\\gamma_1\\) and \\(\\gamma_2\\) for each level of the ordinal scale.\n\n\n7.2.2 Running a proportional odds logistic regression model\nThe MASS package provides a function polr() for running a proportional odds logistic regression model on a data set in a similar way to our previous models. The key (and obvious) requirement is that the outcome is an ordered factor. Since we did our conversions in Section 7.1.3 we are ready to run this model. We will start by running it on all input variables and let the polr() function handle our dummy variables automatically.\n\n# run proportional odds model\nlibrary(MASS)\nmodel &lt;- polr(\n  formula = discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    country + level + result, \n  data = soccer\n)\n\n# get summary\nsummary(model)\n\nCall:\npolr(formula = discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    country + level + result, data = soccer)\n\nCoefficients:\n                  Value Std.

We also see that there are separate intercepts for the various levels of our outcomes, as we also expect. In interpreting our model, we generally don’t have a great deal of interest in the intercepts, but we will focus on the coefficients. First we would like to obtain p-values, so we can add a p-value column using the conversion methods from the t-statistic which we learned in Section 3.3.12.\n\n# get coefficients (it's in matrix form)\ncoefficients &lt;- summary(model)$coefficients\n\n# calculate p-values\np_value &lt;- (1 - pnorm(abs(coefficients[ ,\"t value\"]), 0, 1))*2\n\n# bind back to coefficients\n(coefficients &lt;- cbind(coefficients, p_value))\n\n                     Value Std.

An examination of the coefficients and the AIC of the simpler model will reveal no substantial difference, and therefore we proceed with this model.\n\n\n7.2.3 Calculating the likelihood of an observation being in a specific ordinal category\nRecall from Section 7.2.1 that our proportional odds model generates multiple stratified binomial models, each of which has following form:\n\\[\nP(y \\leq k) = P(y' \\leq \\tau_k)\n\\]\nNote that for an ordinal variable \\(y\\), if \\(y \\leq k\\) and \\(y &gt; k-1\\), then \\(y = k\\). Therefore \\(P(y = k) = P(y \\leq k) - P(y \\leq k - 1)\\). This means we can calculate the specific probability of an observation being in each level of the ordinal variable in our fitted model by simply calculating the difference between the fitted values from each pair of adjacent stratified binomial models. In our walkthrough example, this means we can calculate the specific probability of no action from the referee, or a yellow card being awarded, or a red card being awarded. These can be viewed using the fitted() function.\n\nhead(fitted(model))\n\n       None     Yellow        Red\n1 0.8207093 0.12900184 0.05028889\n2 0.8514232 0.10799553 0.04058128\n3 0.7830785 0.15400189 0.06291964\n4 0.6609864 0.22844107 0.11057249\n5 0.9591298 0.03064719 0.01022301\n6 0.7887766 0.15027145 0.06095200\n\n\nIt can be seen from this output how ordinal logistic regression models can be used in predictive analytics by classifying new observations into the ordinal category with the highest fitted probability. This also allows us to graphically understand the output of a proportional odds model. Figure 7.3 shows the output from a simpler proportional odds model fitted against the n_yellow_25 and n_red_25 input variables, with the fitted probabilities of each level of discipline from the referee plotted on the different colored surfaces. We can see in most situations that no discipline is the most likely outcome and a red card is the least likely outcome. Only at the upper ends of the scales do we see the likelihood of discipline overcoming the likelihood of no discipline, with a strong likelihood of red cards for those with an extremely poor recent disciplinary record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: 3D visualization of a simple proportional odds model for discipline fitted against n_yellow_25 and n_red_25 in the soccer data set. Blue represents the probability of no discipline from the referee. Yellow and red represent the probability of a yellow card and a red card, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Model diagnostics\nSimilar to binomial and multinomial models, pseudo-\\(R^2\\) methods are available for assessing model fit, and AIC can be used to assess model parsimony. Note that DescTools::PseudoR2() also offers AIC.\n\n# diagnostics of simpler model\nDescTools::PseudoR2(\n  model, \n  which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\", \"AIC\")\n)\n\n    McFadden     CoxSnell   Nagelkerke          AIC \n   0.1009411    0.1553264    0.1912445 3464.5339371 \n\n\nThere are numerous tests of goodness-of-fit that can apply to ordinal logistic regression models, and this area is the subject of considerable recent research. The generalhoslem package in R contains routes to four possible tests, with two of them particularly recommended for ordinal models. Each work in a similar way to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test discussed in Section Section 5.3.2, by dividing the sample into groups and comparing the observed versus the fitted outcomes using a chi-square test. Since the null hypothesis is a good model fit, low p-values indicate potential problems with the model. We run these tests below for reference. For more information, see Fagerland and Hosmer (2017), and for a really intensive treatment of ordinal data modeling Agresti (2010) is recommended.\n\n# lipsitz test \ngeneralhoslem::lipsitz.test(model)\n\n\n    Lipsitz goodness of fit test for ordinal response models\n\ndata:  formula:  discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + country + level + formula:      result\nLR statistic = 10.429, df = 9, p-value = 0.3169\n\n\n\n# pulkstenis-robinson test \n# (requires the vector of categorical input variables as an argument)\ngeneralhoslem::pulkrob.chisq(model, catvars = cats)\n\n\n    Pulkstenis-Robinson chi-squared test\n\ndata:  formula:  discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + country + level + formula:      result\nX-squared = 129.29, df = 137, p-value = 0.668",

    "section": "7.3 Testing the proportional odds assumption",
    "text": "7.3 Testing the proportional odds assumption\nAs we discussed earlier, the suitability of a proportional odds logistic regression model depends on the assumption that each input variable has a similar effect on the different levels of the ordinal outcome variable. It is very important to check that this assumption is not violated before proceeding to declare the results of a proportional odds model valid. There are two common approaches to validating the proportional odds assumption, and we will go through each of them here.\n\n7.3.1 Sighting the coefficients of stratified binomial models\nAs we learned above, proportional odds regression models effectively act as a series of stratified binomial models under the assumption that the ‘slope’ of the logistic function of each stratified model is the same. We can verify this by actually running stratified binomial models on our data and checking for similar coefficients on our input variables. Let’s use our walkthrough example to illustrate.\nLet’s create two columns with binary values to correspond to the two higher levels of our ordinal variable.\n\n# create binary variable for \"Yellow\" or \"Red\" versus \"None\"\nsoccer$yellow_plus &lt;- ifelse(soccer$discipline == \"None\", 0, 1)\n\n# create binary variable for \"Red\" versus \"Yellow\" or \"None\"\nsoccer$red &lt;- ifelse(soccer$discipline == \"Red\", 1, 0)\n\nNow let’s create two binomial logistic regression models for the two higher levels of our outcome variable.\n\n# model for at least a yellow card\nyellowplus_model &lt;- glm(\n  yellow_plus ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    result + country + level, \n  data = soccer, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# model for a red card\nred_model &lt;- glm(\n  red ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    result + country + level,\n  data = soccer, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\nWe can now display the coefficients of both models and examine the difference between them.\n\n(coefficient_comparison &lt;- data.frame(\n  yellowplus = summary(yellowplus_model)$coefficients[ , \"Estimate\"],\n  red = summary(red_model)$coefficients[ ,\"Estimate\"],\n  diff = summary(red_model)$coefficients[ ,\"Estimate\"] - \n    summary(yellowplus_model)$coefficients[ , \"Estimate\"]\n))\n\n                yellowplus         red        diff\n(Intercept)    -2.63646519 -3.89865929 -1.26219410\nn_yellow_25     0.34585921  0.32468746 -0.02117176\nn_red_25        0.41454059  0.34213238 -0.07240822\npositionM       0.26108978  0.06387813 -0.19721165\npositionS      -0.72118538 -0.44228286  0.27890252\nresultL         0.46162324  0.64295195  0.18132871\nresultW        -0.77821530 -0.58536482  0.19285048\ncountryGermany  0.13136665  0.10796418 -0.02340247\nlevel2          0.08056718  0.12421593  0.04364875\n\n\nIgnoring the intercept, which is not of concern here, the differences appear relatively small. Large differences in coefficients would indicate that the proportional odds assumption is likely violated and alternative approaches to the problem should be considered.\n\n\n7.3.2 The Brant-Wald test\nIn the previous method, some judgment is required to decide whether the coefficients of the stratified binomial models are ‘different enough’ to decide on violation of the proportional odds assumption. For those requiring more formal support, an option is the Brant-Wald test. Under this test, a generalized ordinal logistic regression model is approximated and compared to the calculated proportional odds model. A generalized ordinal logistic regression model is simply a relaxing of the proportional odds model to allow for different coefficients at each level of the ordinal outcome variable.\nThe Wald test is conducted on the comparison of the proportional odds and generalized models. A Wald test is a hypothesis test of the significance of the difference in model coefficients, producing a chi-square statistic. A low p-value in a Brant-Wald test is an indicator that the coefficient does not satisfy the proportional odds assumption. The brant package in R provides an implementation of the Brant-Wald test, and in this case supports our judgment that the proportional odds assumption holds.\n\nlibrary(brant)\nbrant::brant(model)\n\n-------------------------------------------- \nTest for    X2  df  probability \n-------------------------------------------- \nOmnibus     14.16   8   0.08\nn_yellow_25 0.24    1   0.62\nn_red_25    1.83    1   0.18\npositionM   1.7 1   0.19\npositionS   2.33    1   0.13\ncountryGermany  0.04    1   0.85\nlevel2      0.13    1   0.72\nresultL     1.53    1   0.22\nresultW     1.3 1   0.25\n-------------------------------------------- \n\nH0: Parallel Regression Assumption holds\n\n\nA p-value of less than 0.05 on this test—particularly on the Omnibus plus at least one of the variables—should be interpreted as a failure of the proportional odds assumption.\n\n\n7.3.3 Alternatives to proportional odds models\nThe proportional odds model is by far the most utilized approach to modeling ordinal outcomes (not least because of neglect in the testing of the underlying assumptions). But as we have learned, it is not always an appropriate model choice for ordinal outcomes. When the test of proportional odds fails, we need to consider a strategy for remodeling the data. If only one or two variables fail the test of proportional odds, a simple option is to remove those variables. Whether or not we are comfortable doing this will depend very much on the impact on overall model fit.\nIn the event where the option to remove variables is unattractive, alternative models for ordinal outcomes should be considered. The most common alternatives (which we will not cover in depth here, but are explored in Agresti (2010)) are:\n\nBaseline logistic model. This model is the same as the multinomial regression model covered in the previous chapter, using the lowest ordinal value as the reference.\nAdjacent-category logistic model. This model compares each level of the ordinal variable to the next highest level, and it is a constrained version of the baseline logistic model. The brglm2 package in R offers a function bracl() for calculating an adjacent category logistic model.\nContinuation-ratio logistic model. This model compares each level of the ordinal variable to all lower levels. This can be modeled using binary logistic regression techniques, but new variables need to be constructed from the data set to allow this. The R package rms has a function cr.setup() which is a utility for preparing an outcome variable for a continuation ratio model.",

    "text": "8.1 When to use it\nIn the previous chapters, we have explored how to model outcomes that are continuous, binary or multinomial in nature. We now turn our attention to another common type of data in people analytics: count data. Count data consists of non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, 3, …) that represent the number of times an event has occurred within a specific period of time, location, or group. Examples in the workplace are numerous: the number of safety incidents in a factory per month, the number of days an employee was absent in a year, the number of hires made by a recruiting team in a quarter, or the number of customer complaints received by a service agent in a week.\nBecause count data is not continuous and is bounded below at zero, linear regression is not appropriate. The assumptions of normality and constant variance of residuals are typically violated. A linear model could also illogically predict negative counts. While we could model a binary outcome (e.g., ‘had at least one absence’ vs. ‘had zero absences’) using logistic regression, this approach throws away a lot of valuable information about the magnitude of the count.\nTo properly model count outcomes, we turn to other members of the generalized linear model (GLM) family. First we will look at Poisson regression. Poisson regression is specifically designed for count data and, like logistic regression, uses a transformation–—in this case, the natural logarithm—–to establish a linear relationship between the input variables and the (transformed) outcome. However, Poisson regression rests on a very strong assumption that the mean and variance of the count variable are equal. When this assumption is violated, a condition known as overdispersion occurs, and the Poisson model’s estimates can become unreliable. In this case, we will see that related models, namely Quasi-Poisson or negative binomial regression models, provide more flexible alternatives. Mastering these techniques is essential for any analyst who wants to understand the drivers of event-based phenomena in the workplace.",

    "text": "8.1.1 Origins and intuition of the Poisson distribution\nThe Poisson distribution is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who introduced it in 1837 in a work that focused on the probability of wrongful convictions in court cases1. However, the distribution’s most famous early application came sixty years later from the Polish-Russian economist and statistician Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz.\nBortkiewicz analyzed data on the number of Prussian cavalry soldiers who were fatally kicked by their horses each year across 14 different army corps over a 20-year period. He observed that this was a “rare event.” In any given corps in any given year, the number of deaths was very low, but it was not zero. He found that the observed frequency of 0, 1, 2, or more deaths per corps-year closely matched the predictions of the Poisson distribution. The key insight is that the Poisson distribution effectively models the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events happen with a known constant mean rate (denoted by \\(\\lambda\\)) and are independent of the time since the last event. The shape of the distribution for different mean rates is shown in Figure 8.1. For a low mean, the distribution is highly skewed with most observations at or near zero. As the mean increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric and starts to resemble a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Poisson distributions showing how the shape changes with different mean event rates \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\n\nThe core idea of modeling rates is central to Poisson regression. We are not just modeling a count; we are modeling the expected rate at which events occur, and then examining how different factors or characteristics influence that rate.\n\n\n8.1.2 Use cases for count regression\nPoisson, Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression can be used when the outcome of interest is a count of events. Here are some example questions that could be approached using these methods:\n\nWhat are the characteristics of employees that are associated with a higher number of days of unplanned absence per year?\nWhat are the characteristics of job postings that are associated with a higher number of applicants in the first 30 days?\nWhat elements in a factory’s environment are related to the number of safety incidents per month?\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst at a large technology firm. The HR leadership team is concerned about employee absenteeism and wants to understand its drivers to better target support and intervention programs. They believe that factors like an employee’s tenure with the company, their performance, and whether or not they are a manager could all play a role.\nYou are provided with a data set of 865 employees for the most recent full year. The absenteeism data set contains the following fields:\n\ndays_absent: The number of unscheduled days of absence for the employee in the last calendar year (our outcome variable).\ntenure: The employee’s tenure at the company in years.\nis_manager: A binary value indicating 1 if the employee is a manager and 0 if not.\nperformance_rating: The employee’s most recent performance score on a scale from 1 to 5.\n\nLet’s download the absenteeism data set and take a quick look at it.\n\n# if needed, download data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/absenteeism.csv\"\nabsenteeism &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\nhead(absenteeism)\n\n  days_absent tenure is_manager performance_rating\n1           2     16          0                  2\n2          13      4          0                  5\n3           0      0          0                  3\n4           8     24          0                  5\n5          12      9          0                  3\n6           8      3          0                  4\n\n\nThe data looks as expected, but we should do some type conversion for the is_manager column before we get a summary.\n\n# convert is_manager to factor\nabsenteeism$is_manager &lt;- as.factor(absenteeism$is_manager)\n\nsummary(absenteeism)\n\n  days_absent        tenure      is_manager performance_rating\n Min.   : 0.00   Min.   : 0.00   0:753      Min.   :1.000     \n 1st Qu.: 3.00   1st Qu.: 8.00   1:112      1st Qu.:3.000     \n Median : 7.00   Median :15.00              Median :3.000     \n Mean   :10.26   Mean   :15.16              Mean   :3.473     \n 3rd Qu.:14.00   3rd Qu.:23.00              3rd Qu.:4.000     \n Max.   :62.00   Max.   :30.00              Max.   :5.000     \n\n\nWe see that days_absent ranges from 0 to 62, with a mean of 10.26. The distribution of absences is shown in Figure 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Distribution of days_absent with histogram and density plot\n\n\n\nThis is a highly right-skewed distribution, with most employees having a low number of absences and a “long tail” of employees with a high number of absences. This is a classic shape for count data, and suggests that Poisson regression is a good initial approach for this problem.",

    "section": "8.2 Modeling count outcomes with Poisson regression",
    "text": "8.2 Modeling count outcomes with Poisson regression\nWe cannot directly model a count outcome with a linear equation because the expected count must be non-negative. As with logistic regression, we will need a transformation to connect the linear combination of our input variables to the expected count.\n\n8.2.1 The Poisson model and the log transformation\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution gives the probability of observing exactly \\(k\\) events in an interval, given a mean event rate of \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\nP(Y=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n\\]\nWe assume that the expected event count \\(\\lambda_i\\) for each individual observation \\(i\\) depends on that observation’s input variables (\\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\dots, x_{ip}\\)). To ensure that our predicted \\(\\lambda_i\\) is always positive, we model the natural logarithm of \\(\\lambda_i\\) as a linear function of the input variables. This is the log transformation.\n\\[\n\\ln(\\lambda_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\beta_2x_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{ip}\n\\]\nThis equation should look familiar. It’s a linear model, just like in linear regression. The crucial difference is that we are not modeling the expected count outcome directly; we are modeling the log of the expected count.\nBy exponentiating both sides, we can see how the input variables relate to the expected count itself:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda_i &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\beta_2x_{i2} + \\dots + \\beta_px_{ip}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^{x_{i1}}(e^{\\beta_2})^{x_{i2}}\\dots(e^{\\beta_p})^{x_{ip}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis shows that the effects of the input variables are multiplicative on the expected count \\(\\lambda_i\\). This is analogous to work we have done in previous chapters, where logistic regression coefficients have a multiplicative effect on the odds of an outcome.\n\n\n8.2.2 Fitting and interpreting a Poisson regression model\nLet’s fit a Poisson model to our absenteeism data to understand the drivers of absent days. We use the glm() function, specifying family = \"poisson\" which automatically uses the log transformation.\n\n# run a poisson model\nabsent_poisson_model &lt;- glm(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating,\n                            data = absenteeism,\n                            family = \"poisson\")\n\n# view the summary\nsummary(absent_poisson_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating, \n    family = \"poisson\", data = absenteeism)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

We have coefficient estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values. Let’s interpret the tenure coefficient. For a one-year increase in tenure, the log of the expected number of absent days increases by 0.0511, holding all other variables constant. A much more intuitive interpretation comes from exponentiating the coefficients. The exponentiated value is called an Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR). The IRR tells us the multiplicative factor by which the expected count changes for a one-unit increase in the predictor.\nLet’s calculate the IRRs for our model.\n\n# Exponentiate coefficients to get Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs)\n(irr &lt;- exp(coef(absent_poisson_model)))\n\n       (Intercept)             tenure        is_manager1 performance_rating \n         4.5060347          1.0524742          0.8538633          0.9901123 \n\n\nNow we can interpret these more easily:\n\nIntercept: 4.51 is the expected number of absent days for a brand new non-manager with a performance rating of 1. This is not practically meaningful, but serves as the baseline for the model.\ntenure: The IRR is 1.0525. For each additional year of tenure, the expected count of absent days increases by about 5.25%, holding other factors constant.\nis_manager1: The IRR is 0.8539. This means that being a manager (compared to not being a manager) is associated with an expected absent day count that is 0.8539 times the count for a non-manager, or about 14.61% lower, holding other factors constant.\nperformance_rating: The IRR is 0.9901. For each one-point increase in performance score, the expected number of absent days decreases by about 0.99%, holding other factors constant. However, this effect is not statistically significant.\n\nJust as with logistic regression, we can calculate confidence intervals for these IRRs to understand the range of plausible values for the effect.\n\n# Confidence intervals for the IRRs\nexp(confint(absent_poisson_model))\n\n                       2.5 %    97.5 %\n(Intercept)        4.0513303 5.0097586\ntenure             1.0498634 1.0551020\nis_manager1        0.7999133 0.9104788\nperformance_rating 0.9635426 1.0174134\n\n\nFor example, we are 95% confident that for each additional year of tenure, the incidence rate ratio is between 1.05 and 1.055. Since this entire range is above 1, we can be confident that the relationship is positive and statistically significant.",

    "section": "8.3 Model diagnostics: overdispersion",
    "text": "8.3 Model diagnostics: overdispersion\nBefore we can trust our Poisson model’s conclusions, we must check its primary assumption: that the mean (expected value) and variance of the count outcome are approximately equal. That is, \\(E(y) \\approx Var(y)\\). In real-world data, this assumption is rarely met. It is far more common for the variance to be larger than the mean. This is called overdispersion (\\(Var(y) &gt; E(y)\\))2.\nOverdispersion is common for a number of reasons, including:\n\nUnobserved Heterogeneity: There may be other unmeasured factors that influence the count. For instance, in our example some employees might have chronic health conditions that make them more prone to absence. This creates extra variability in the counts that is not captured by our input variables.\nClustering or Non-independence: Events may not be independent. If one person in a team gets a virus or flu, it might spread, leading to a cluster of absences. This violates the Poisson assumption that events are independent.\n\nIf we use a Poisson model on overdispersed data, the coefficient estimates (\\(\\beta\\)) are still unbiased (correct on average), but their standard errors are underestimated. This makes the z-scores artificially large and the p-values artificially small. We might therefore conclude that a predictor is statistically significant when, in fact, it is not. Therefore, the model can become overconfident in its findings.\n\n8.3.1 Detecting overdispersion\nThere are several ways to check for overdispersion.\n\nCompare Mean and Variance: The simplest check is to compare the raw mean and variance of our outcome variable.\n\nc(mean = mean(absenteeism$days_absent), \n  variance = var(absenteeism$days_absent))\n\n     mean  variance \n 10.26243 103.25397 \n\n\nThe variance (103.25) is much larger than the mean (10.26), which is a strong initial sign of overdispersion.\nCalculate the Dispersion Parameter: A more formal check comes from the model itself. The dispersion parameter is calculated by dividing the model’s residual deviance by its residual degrees of freedom. For a Poisson model, this value should be close to 1. A value significantly greater than 1 indicates overdispersion.\n\n# Calculate dispersion parameter\n(dispersion_param &lt;- summary(absent_poisson_model)$deviance / summary(absent_poisson_model)$df.residual)\n\n[1] 6.735929\n\n\nOur dispersion parameter of 6.74 is substantially greater than 1, confirming that our data is overdispersed and the Poisson model is likely not appropriate.\nFormal Hypothesis Test: The AER package provides a formal test for overdispersion. The null hypothesis is that the data is equidispersed (mean = variance), while the alternative is that it is overdispersed. A small p-value provides evidence for overdispersion.\n\nlibrary(AER)\ndispersiontest(absent_poisson_model)\n\n\n    Overdispersion test\n\ndata:  absent_poisson_model\nz = 13.31, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true dispersion is greater than 1\nsample estimates:\ndispersion \n  6.926057 \n\n\nThe very small p-value leads us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that overdispersion is present. This suggests that we should search for an alternative approach that can handle overdispersed count data.\n\nWhen we have confirmed that our count data is overdispersed, there are two alternative methods we can use: Quasi-Poisson regression and negative binomial regression.\n\n\n8.3.2 Quasi-Poisson regression\nQuasi-Poisson regression, which is a simple extension of the Poisson model, relaxes the assumption that the mean and variance are equal, allowing the variance to be a linear function of the mean. That is\n\\[\nVar(y) = \\theta \\mu\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is a dispersion parameter estimated from the data and \\(\\mu\\) is the average event count (equivalent to \\(\\lambda\\) in the Poisson model). We expect \\(\\theta &gt; 1\\) in the presence of overdispersion, and a greater \\(\\theta\\) means greater dispersion. The coefficient estimates in a Quasi-Poisson model are identical to the Poisson model, but the standard errors are adjusted, which affects which input variables are returned as significant.\nQuasi-Poisson regression can be performed in R using the glm() function with family = \"quasipoisson\".\n\n# run a quasi-poisson model\nabsent_quasi_poisson_model &lt;- glm(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating,\n                                  data = absenteeism,\n                                  family = \"quasipoisson\")\n\n# view the summary\nsummary(absent_quasi_poisson_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating, \n    family = \"quasipoisson\", data = absenteeism)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

The coefficient estimates are the same as in the Poisson model, so the IRRs are unchanged.\n\n\n8.3.3 Negative binomial regression\nAnother option in the presence of overdispersion is to use negative binomial regression. The negative binomial distribution is a generalization of the Poisson distribution that includes an additional dispersion parameter which allows the variance to be greater than the mean.\nThe variance for a negative binomial distribution is modeled as:\n\\[\nVar(y) = \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\theta}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is a dispersion parameter, so the term \\(\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\theta}\\) allows for the extra variance. Note that in this model the variance is a quadratic function of the mean, rather than the linear function used in the Quasi-Poisson model. Note also that a greater \\(\\theta\\) means less dispersion, and as \\(\\theta\\) gets larger and approaches infinity, the term \\(\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\theta}\\) approaches zero, and the variance approaches the mean \\(\\mu\\). In this case, the negative binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distribution.\nWe can fit a negative binomial model in R using the glm.nb() function from the MASS package. The syntax is identical to glm().\n\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n# run a negative binomial model\nabsent_nb_model &lt;- glm.nb(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating,\n                          data = absenteeism)\n\n# view the summary\nsummary(absent_nb_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm.nb(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating, \n    data = absenteeism, init.theta = 1.553571254, link = log)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

This is the estimated dispersion parameter \\(\\theta\\). The summary() also provides a standard error for \\(\\theta\\) and tests whether it is significantly different from infinity (i.e., whether the negative binomial model is a significant improvement over the Poisson model).\nThe interpretation of the coefficients is exactly the same as in the Poisson model. They are on the log-count scale, and we exponentiate them to get Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs).\n\n# IRRs for the negative binomial model\n(irr_nb &lt;- exp(coef(absent_nb_model)))\n\n       (Intercept)             tenure        is_manager1 performance_rating \n         4.8117411          1.0509798          0.8707365          0.9777244 \n\n\nLet’s compare these with the IRRs from our original Poisson model.\n\n# Compare IRRs side-by-side\ncbind(IRR_Poisson = irr, IRR_NB = irr_nb)\n\n                   IRR_Poisson    IRR_NB\n(Intercept)          4.5060347 4.8117411\ntenure               1.0524742 1.0509798\nis_manager1          0.8538633 0.8707365\nperformance_rating   0.9901123 0.9777244\n\n\nThe point estimates for the IRRs are quite similar. This is expected, as the coefficients are generally unbiased even when a Poisson model is used on overdispersed data. The real difference is in the standard errors and p-values.\n\n# Compare standard errors\ncbind(SE_Poisson = summary(absent_poisson_model)$coefficients[, \"Std. Error\"],\n      SE_NB = summary(absent_nb_model)$coefficients[, \"Std.

By accounting for the overdispersion, the negative binomial model provides more realistic (and conservative) estimates of the uncertainty around our coefficients. This leads to larger p-values and more trustworthy inferences. In this case, while tenure remains a significant input variable, we see that is_manager is no longer significant.\n\n\n8.3.4 Comparing Poisson and negative binomial models\nWe have strong evidence that the negative binomial model is a better choice compared to the original Poisson model, but we can also formally compare the models. Since the Poisson model is a nested version of the negative binomial model (it’s what you get when \\(\\theta \\to \\infty\\)), we can use a likelihood ratio test using the lmtest package to see if the addition of the \\(\\theta\\) parameter provides a significant improvement in fit. This is a notable advantage of the negative binomial model over the Quasi-Poisson model, which does not have a likelihood function and therefore cannot be compared in this way.\n\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlrtest(absent_poisson_model, absent_nb_model)\n\nLikelihood ratio test\n\nModel 1: days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating\nModel 2: days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating\n  #Df  LogLik Df Chisq Pr(&gt;Chisq)    \n1   4 -4459.5                        \n2   5 -2813.5  1  3292  &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe extremely small p-value indicates that the negative binomial model provides a significantly better fit to the data than the Poisson model.\nWe can also compare the models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which as we have learned previously is a measure of model parsimony. Since both of our models use the same input variables, a lower AIC indicates a better fit.\n\nAIC(absent_poisson_model, absent_nb_model)\n\n                     df      AIC\nabsent_poisson_model  4 8927.050\nabsent_nb_model       5 5637.075\n\n\nThe AIC for the negative binomial model is substantially lower than for the Poisson model, again confirming that it is the superior and more parsimonious model for our overdispersed data.\nNote that it is not advisable to use Pseudo R-squared metrics to compare Poisson and negative binomial models, as these metrics can be misleading in the presence of overdispersion. These metrics are more appropriate for comparing models of the same family (e.g., two Poisson models with different input variables).",

    "section": "8.4 Other considerations in count regression",
    "text": "8.4 Other considerations in count regression\nIn this section we provide a brief overview of some additional topics that are relevant when working with count data. For deeper study on this topic, Hilbe (2014) is an excellent introductory text, while Friendly and Meyer (2016) provides a more advanced treatment on the analysis of discrete data more broadly.\n\n8.4.1 Prediction\nPredicting expected counts from a new set of data works just like in other glm models. We use the predict() function with type = \"response\" to get the prediction on the original count scale (i.e., the expected number of events, \\(\\lambda_i\\)).\n\n# define new observations\n(new_employees &lt;- data.frame(tenure = c(2, 25, 15),\n                             is_manager = as.factor(c(0, 1, 0)),\n                             performance_rating = c(4, 3, 3)))\n\n  tenure is_manager performance_rating\n1      2          0                  4\n2     25          1                  3\n3     15          0                  3\n\n# predict expected days absent using our final NB model\npredict(absent_nb_model, new_employees, type = \"response\")\n\n        1         2         3 \n 4.856874 13.573681  9.481285 \n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Exposure and offsets\nSometimes we are not just modeling a raw count, but a rate relative to some measure of “exposure”. For example, we might want to model the number of safety incidents, but we know that a large factory with 1,000 employees is naturally going to have more incidents than a small one with 100 employees, even if the small factory is less safe. We need to control for this exposure.\nIn this case, our outcome of interest is really the rate of incidents per employee. Let’s say we model\n\\[\nE[\\mathrm{incidents}_i] = \\mathrm{rate}_i \\times \\mathrm{employees}_i\n\\]\nTaking logs, we get\n\\[\n\\ln(E[\\mathrm{incidents}_i]) = \\ln(\\mathrm{rate}_i) + \\ln(\\mathrm{employees}_i)\n\\]\nWe model the log-rate as a linear combination of input variables:\n\\[\n\\ln(\\mathrm{rate}_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\dots\n\\]\nSubstituting this in gives:\n\\[\n\\ln(E[\\mathrm{incidents}_i]) = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\dots) + \\ln(\\mathrm{employees}_i)\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\ln(\\mathrm{employees}_i)\\) is called an offset. It is an input variable whose coefficient is fixed to 1. We include it in the model to account for the varying exposure time or group size. In R’s glm() and glm.nb(), this is specified using the offset() function inside the formula. For example\nglm(incidents ~ X1 + X2 + offset(log(employees)), family=poisson)\n\n\n8.4.3 Zero-inflation\nSometimes count data has an excess of zeros beyond what would be expected from a Poisson or negative binomial distribution. This can occur when there are two processes at work: one determining whether the event can occur at all, and another determining how many times it occurs. For example, some employees might never be absent due to perfect health and proximity to work (structural zeros), while others have some probability of absence following a count distribution.\nIf you believe there may be structural reasons for an excess of zeros in your data, you can use the performance package in R to check for zero-inflation in a Poisson or negative binomial model. First we will check for our Poisson model.\n\n# check for zero-inflation in Poisson model\nlibrary(performance)\ncheck_zeroinflation(absent_poisson_model)\n\n# Check for zero-inflation\n\n   Observed zeros: 56\n  Predicted zeros: 2\n            Ratio: 0.04\n\n\nThe output indicates that our Poisson model may have too many zeros compared to what would normally be expected in a Poisson distribution. In this situation, we could consider using a zero-inflated model, which combines a binary model for the zero/non-zero outcome with a count model for the non-zero outcomes. The pscl package in R offers a function zeroinfl() to fit these models. The formula syntax is similar to glm(), but we can specify separate input variables for the zero-inflation part of the model.\nHere we fit a zero-inflated Poisson model to our absenteeism data.\n\nlibrary(pscl)\n\n# fit zero-inflated Poisson model using all variables for both the zero-inflated and poisson parts\n\nzip_model &lt;- zeroinfl(\n  # poisson input variables first, binomial second\n  days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating | tenure + is_manager + performance_rating,\n  data = absenteeism,\n  dist = \"poisson\"\n)\n\nsummary(zip_model)\n\n\nCall:\nzeroinfl(formula = days_absent ~ tenure + is_manager + performance_rating | \n    tenure + is_manager + performance_rating, data = absenteeism, dist = \"poisson\")\n\nPearson residuals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.6724 -1.5248 -0.4967  0.9931  9.6365 \n\nCount model coefficients (poisson with log link):\n                    Estimate Std.

The second set of coefficients are from a binomial logistic regression model on an outcome of whether an observation is a structural zero. Here we see that higher tenure is significantly negatively associated with being a structural zero, meaning that employees with longer tenure are less likely to be in the always-zero group.\nHowever, we know that overdispersion is present in our data, which could be a better explanation for the excess zeros, especially if we have no basis to support a structural reasobn. So let’s check whether there is zero-inflation in our negative binomial model.\n\n# check for zero-inflation in negative binomial model\ncheck_zeroinflation(absent_nb_model)\n\n# Check for zero-inflation\n\n   Observed zeros: 56\n  Predicted zeros: 49\n            Ratio: 0.88\n\n\nIt seems unlikely based on this check that zero-inflation is an issue in the negative binomial model, so the excess zeros could well be a consequence of overdispersion.

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.1 Mixed models for explicit hierarchy in data\nSo far in this book we have learned all of the most widely used and foundational regression techniques for inferential modeling. Starting with this chapter, we will look at situations where we need to adapt or combine techniques to address certain inference goals or data characteristics. In this chapter we look at some situations where data has a hierarchy and where we wish to consider this hierarchy in our modeling efforts.\nIt is very often the case that data has an explicit hierarchy. For example, each observation in our data may refer to a different individual and each such individual may be a member of a few different groups. Similarly, each observation might refer to an event involving an individual, and we may have data on multiple events for the same individual. For a particular problem that we are modeling, we may wish to take into consideration the effect of the hierarchical grouping. This requires a model which has a mixture of random effects and fixed effects—called a mixed model.\nSeparately, it can be the case that data we are given could have a latent hierarchy. The input variables in the data might be measures of a smaller set of higher-level latent constructs, and we may have a more interpretable model if we hypothesize, confirm and model those latent constructs against our outcome of interest rather than using a larger number of explicit input variables. Latent variable modeling is a common technique to address this situation, and in this chapter we will review a form of latent variable modeling called structural equation modeling, which is very effective especially in making inferences from survey instruments with large numbers of items.\nThese topics are quite broad, and there are many different approaches, techniques and terms involved in mixed modeling and latent variable modeling. In this chapter we will only cover some of the simpler approaches, which would suffice for the majority of common situations in people analytics. For a deeper treatment of these topics, see Jiang (2007) for mixed models and Bartholomew, Knott, and Moustaki (2011) or Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2004) for latent variable models.\nThe most common explicit hierarchies that we see in data are group-based and time-based. A group-based hierarchy occurs when we are taking observations that belong to different groups. For example, in our first walkthrough example in Chapter 4, we modeled final examination performance against examination performance for the previous three years. In this case we considered each student observation to be independent and identically distributed, and we ran a linear regression model on all the students. If we were to receive additional information that these students were actually a mix of students in different degree programs, then we may wish to take this into account in how we model the problem—that is, we would want to assume that each student observation is only independent and identically distributed within each degree program.\nSimilarly, a time-based hierarchy occurs when we have multiple observations of the same subject taken at different times. For example, if we are conducting a weekly survey on the same people over the course of a year, and we are modeling how answers to some questions might depend on answers to others, we may wish to consider the effect of the person on this model.\nBoth of these situations introduce a new grouping variable into the problem we are modeling, thus creating a hierarchy. It is not hard to imagine that analyzing each group may produce different statistical properties compared to analyzing the entire population—for example, there could be correlations between the data inside groups which are less evident when looking at the overall population. Therefore in some cases a model may provide more useful inferences if this grouping is taken into account.",

    "text": "9.1.1 Fixed and random effects\nLet’s imagine that we have a set of observations consisting of a continuous outcome variable \\(y\\) and input variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\). Let’s also assume that we have an additional data point for each observation where we assign it to a group \\(G\\). We are asked to determine the relationship between the outcome and the input variables. One option is to develop a linear model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p + \\epsilon\\), ignoring the group data. In this model, we assume that the coefficients all have a fixed effect on the input variables—that is, they act on every observation in the same way. This may be fine if there is trust that group membership is unlikely to have any impact on the relationship being modeled, or if we are comfortable making inferences about variables at the observation level only.\nIf, however, there is a belief that group membership may have an effect on the relationship being modeled, and if we are interested in interpreting our model at the group and observation level, then we need to adjust our model to a mixed model for more accurate and reliable inference. The most common adjustment is a random intercept. In this situation, we imagine that group membership has an effect on the ‘starting point’ of the relationship: the intercept. Therefore, for a given observation \\(y = \\alpha_G + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p + \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\alpha_G\\) is a random effect with a mean of zero associated with the group that the observation is a member of. This can be restated as:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_G + \\beta_1x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_G = \\alpha_G + \\beta_0\\), which is a random intercept with a mean of \\(\\beta_0\\).\nThis model is very similar to a standard linear regression model, except instead of having a fixed intercept, we have an intercept that varies by group. Therefore, we will essentially have two ‘levels’ in our model: one at the observation level to describe \\(y\\) and one at the group level to describe \\(\\beta_G\\). For this reason mixed models are sometimes known as multilevel models.\nIt is not too difficult to see how this approach can be extended. For example, suppose that we believe the groups also have an effect on the coefficient of the input variable \\(x_1\\) as well as the intercept. Then\n\\[\ny = \\beta_{G0} + \\beta_{G1}x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n\\] where \\(\\beta_{G0}\\) is a random intercept with a mean of \\(\\beta_0\\), and \\(\\beta_{G1}\\) is a random slope with a mean of \\(\\beta_1\\). In this case, a mixed model would return the estimated coefficients at the observation level and the statistics for the random effects \\(\\beta_{G0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{G1}\\) at the group level.\nFinally, our model does not need to be linear for this to apply. This approach also extends to logistic models and other generalized linear models. For example, if \\(y\\) was a binary outcome variable and our model was a binomial logistic regression model, our last equation would translate to\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_{G0} + \\beta_{G1}x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\n\\]\n\n\n9.1.2 Running a mixed model\nLet’s look at a fun and straightforward example of how mixed models can be useful. The speed_dating data set is a set of information captured during experiments with speed dating by students at Columbia University in New York1. Each row represents one meeting between an individual and a partner of the opposite sex. The data contains the following fields:\n\niid is an id number for the individual.\ngender is the gender of the individual with 0 as Female and 1 as Male.\nmatch indicates that the meeting resulted in a match.\nsamerace indicates that both the individual and the partner were of the same race.\nrace is the race of the individual, with race coded as follows: Black/African American=1, European/Caucasian-American=2, Latino/Hispanic American=3, Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian-American=4, Native American=5, Other=6.\ngoal is the reason why the individual is participating in the event, coded as follows: Seemed like a fun night out=1, To meet new people=2, To get a date=3, Looking for a serious relationship=4, To say I did it=5, Other=6.\ndec is a binary rating from the individual as to whether they would like to see their partner again (1 is Yes and 0 is No).\nattr is the individual’s rating out of 10 on the attractiveness of the partner.\nintel is the individual’s rating out of 10 on the intelligence level of the partner.\nprob is the individual’s rating out of 10 on whether they believe the partner will want to see them again.\nagediff is the absolute difference in the ages of the individual and the partner.\n\nThis data can be explored in numerous ways, but we will focus here on modeling options. We are interested in the binary outcome dec (the decision of the individual), and we would like to understand how it relates to the age difference, the racial similarity and the ratings on attr, intel and prob. First, let’s assume that we don’t care about how an individual makes up their mind about their speed date, and that we are only interested in the dynamics of speed date decisions. Then we would simply run a binomial logistic regression on our data set, ignoring iid and other grouping variables like race, goal and gender.\n\n# if needed, get data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/speed_dating.csv\"\nspeed_dating &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# run standard binomial model\nmodel &lt;- glm(dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob, \n             data = speed_dating, \n             family = \"binomial\")\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob, \n    family = \"binomial\", data = speed_dating)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Different individuals may have different ingoing criteria for making speed dating decisions. As a result, each individual may have varying base likelihoods of a positive decision, and each individual may be affected by the input variables in different ways as they come to their decision. Therefore we will need to assign random effects for individuals based on iid. The lme4 package in R contains functions for performing mixed linear regression models and mixed generalized linear regression models. These functions take formulas with additional terms to define the random effects to be estimated. The function for a linear model is lmer() and for a generalized linear model is glmer().\nIn the simple case, let’s assume that each individual has a different ingoing base likelihood of making a positive decision on a speed date. We will therefore model a random intercept according to the iid of the individual. Here we would use the formula dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob + (1 | iid), where (1 | iid) means ‘a random effect for iid on the intercept of the model’.\n\n# run binomial mixed effects model\nlibrary(lme4)\n\niid_intercept_model &lt;- lme4:::glmer(\n  dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob + (1 | iid),\n  data = speed_dating,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n\n# view summary without correlation table of fixed effects\nsummary(iid_intercept_model, \n        correlation = FALSE)\n\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob + (1 | iid)\n   Data: speed_dating\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   6420.3    6469.0   -3203.1    6406.3      7782 \n\nScaled residuals: \n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-25.6966  -0.3644  -0.0606   0.3608  25.0369 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n iid    (Intercept) 5.18     2.276   \nNumber of obs: 7789, groups:  iid, 541\n\nFixed effects:\n             Estimate Std.

The fixed effects level gives the coefficients of the model at an observation (speed date) level, and the random effects tell us how the intercept (or base likelihood) of that model can vary according to the individual. We see that there is considerable variance in the intercept from individual to individual, and taking this into account, we now see that the decision of an individual on a given date is significantly influenced by all the factors in this model. If we had stuck with the simple binomial model, the effects of age difference, racial similarity and intelligence at an individual level would have gotten lost, and we could have reached the erroneous conclusion that none of these really matter in speed dating.\nTo illustrate this graphically, Figure 9.2 shows the speed_dating data for a subset of the three individuals with IIDs 252, 254 and 256. The curve represents a plain binomial logistic regression model fitted on the attr and prob input variables, irrelevant of the IID of the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: 3D visualization of the fitted plain binomial model against a subset of the speed_dating data for three specific iids\n\n\nFigure 9.4 shows the three separate curves for each IID generated by a mixed binomial logistic regression model with a random intercept fitted on the same two input variables. Here, we can see that different individuals process the two inputs in their decision making in different ways, leading to different individual formulas which determine the likelihood of a positive decision. While a plain binomial regression model will find the best single formula from the data irrelevant of the individual, a mixed model allows us to take these different individual formulas into account in determining the effects of the input variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: 3D visualization of the individual-level binomial models created by iid_intercept_model against a subset of the speed_dating data for three specific iids\n\n\nIf we believe that different individuals are influenced differently by one or more of the various decision factors they consider during a speed date, we can extend our random effects to the slope coefficients of our model. For example we could use (1 + agediff | iid) to model a random effect of iid on the intercept and the agediff coefficient. Similarly, if we wanted to consider two grouping variables—like iid and goal—on the intercept, we could add both (1 | iid) and (1 | goal) to our model formula.\n\n\n9.1.3 Mixed effects models using Python\nThe pymer4 package provides a simple implementation of linear and generalized linear mixed effects models. The glmer() function is used for generalized linear mixed models, and the specific model is defined by the family parameter. This package is implemented in R under the hood, and also requires Polars rather than Pandas DataFrames. To avoid issues related to the back-end R code, it is recommended that you explicitly remove all rows containing NaN values before fitting a model, or else perform imputation to fill these values.\nTo recreate our model random intercept model from the previous section using pymer4, we would use the following code:\n\nfrom pymer4.models import glmer\nimport pandas as pd\nimport polars as pl\n\nurl = \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/speed_dating.csv\"\n\n# load data and drop rows with NaN values, then convert to Polars\nspeed_dating = pd.read_csv(url).dropna()\nspeed_dating = pl.DataFrame(speed_dating) \n\n# fit binomial mixed effects model\nmodel = glmer(\"dec ~ agediff + samerace + attr + intel + prob + (1 | iid)\",\n             data = speed_dating, family = 'binomial')\nmodel.fit()\n\n# view the table of results\nmodel.summary()._tbl_data\n\n\nshape: (9, 10)\n\n\n\nrfx\nparam\nestimate\nconf_low\nconf_high\nstd_error\nz_stat\ndf\np_value\nstars\n\n\nstr\nstr\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nstr\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"iid-sd\"\n\"(Intercept)\"\n2.278032\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\n\n\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\n\n\n\"Fixed Effects:\"\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\nnull\n\n\nnull\n\"(Intercept)\"\n-12.893847\n-13.721121\n-12.066572\n0.422087\n-30.547861\ninf\n\"&lt;.001\"\n\"***\"\n\n\nnull\n\"agediff\"\n-0.036687\n-0.064145\n-0.009229\n0.014009\n-2.618721\ninf\n\"0.008826\"\n\"**\"\n\n\nnull\n\"samerace\"\n0.198032\n0.038387\n0.357678\n0.081453\n2.43124\ninf\n\"0.01505\"\n\"*\"\n\n\nnull\n\"attr\"\n1.07863\n1.013247\n1.144012\n0.033359\n32.33411\ninf\n\"&lt;.001\"\n\"***\"\n\n\nnull\n\"intel\"\n0.316896\n0.248741\n0.385052\n0.034774\n9.113025\ninf\n\"&lt;.001\"\n\"***\"\n\n\nnull\n\"prob\"\n0.619761\n0.563438\n0.676085\n0.028737\n21.566592\ninf\n\"&lt;.001\"\n\"***\"",

    "text": "9.2 Structural equation models for latent hierarchy in data\nIn this section we will focus entirely on survey data use cases, as this is the most common application of structural equation modeling in people analytics. However it should be noted that survey data is not the only situation where latent variables may be modeled, and this technology has substantially broader applications. Indeed, advanced practitioners may see opportunities to experiment with this technology in other use cases.\nIt is a frequent occurrence with surveys conducted on large samples of people, such as a public survey or a large company survey, that attempts to run regression models can be problematic due to the large number of survey questions or items. Often many of the items are highly correlated, and even if they were not, high dimensionality makes interpretability very challenging. Decision-makers are not usually interested in explanations that involve 50 or 100 variables.\nUsually, such a large number of survey items are not each independently measuring a different construct. Many of the items can be considered to be addressing similar thematic constructs. For example, the items ‘I believe I am compensated well’ and ‘I am happy with the benefits offered by my employer’ could both be considered to be related to employee rewards. In some cases, survey instruments can be explicitly constructed around these themes, and in other cases, surveys have grown organically over time to include a disorganized set of items that could be grouped into themes after the fact.\nIt is a common request for an analyst to model a certain outcome using the many items in a complex survey as input variables. In some cases the outcome being modeled is an item in the survey itself—usually some overall measure of sentiment—or in other cases the outcome could be independent of the survey instrument, for example future attrition from the organization. In this situation, a model using the themes as input variables is likely to be a lot more useful and interpretable than a model using the items as input variables.\nStructural equation modeling is a technique that allows an analyst to hypothesize a smaller set of latent variables or factors that explain the responses to the survey items themselves (the ‘measured variables’), and then regresses the outcome of interest against these latent factors. It is a two-part approach, each part being a separate model in and of itself, as follows:\n\nMeasurement model: This is focused on how well the hypothesized factors explain the responses to the survey items using a technique called factor analysis. In the most common case, where a subject matter expert has pre-organized the items into several groups corresponding to hypothesized latent variables, the process is called confirmatory factor analysis, and the objective is to confirm that the groupings represent a high-quality measurement model, adjusting as necessary to refine the model. In the simplest case, items are fitted into separate independent themes with no overlap.\nStructural model: Assuming a satisfactory measurement model, the structural model is effectively a regression model which explains how each of the proposed factors relate to the outcome of interest.\n\nAs a walkthrough example, we will work with the politics_survey data set.\n\n# if needed, get data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/politics_survey.csv\"\npolitics_survey &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\nThis data set represents the results of a survey conducted by a political party on a set of approximately 2100 voters. The results are on a Likert scale of 1 to 4 where 1 indicates strong negative sentiment with a statement and 4 indicates strong positive sentiment. Subject matter experts have already grouped the items into proposed latent variables or factors, and the data takes the following form:\n\nOverall represents the overall intention to vote for the party in the next election.\nItems beginning with Pol are considered to be related to the policies of the political party.\nItems beginning with Hab are considered to be related to prior voting habits in relation to the political party.\nItems beginning with Loc are considered to be related to interest in local issues around where the respondent resided.\nItems beginning with Env are considered to be related to interest in environmental issues.\nItems beginning with Int are considered to be related to interest in international issues.\nItems beginning with Pers are considered to be related to the personalities of the party representatives/leaders.\nItems beginning with Nat are considered to be related to interest in national issues.\nItems beginning with Eco are considered to be related to interest in economic issues.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the data.\n\nhead(politics_survey)\n\n  Overall Pol1 Pol2 Pol3 Hab1 Hab2 Hab3 Loc1 Loc2 Loc3 Loc4 Env1 Env2 Int1 Int2\n1       3    2    2    2    2    2    2    3    3    2    2    2    3    3    3\n2       4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    3\n3       4    4    4    4    3    2    2    4    4    4    4    4    4    4    4\n4       3    4    4    4    3    2    2    4    3    3    4    4    4    4    3\n5       3    3    3    4    4    3    3    3    4    3    3    4    4    3    4\n6       4    3    3    4    3    2    3    3    3    2    2    3    3    4    3\n  Pers1 Pers2 Pers3 Nat1 Nat2 Nat3 Eco1 Eco2\n1     3     4     4    3    3    4    3    3\n2     4     4     4    4    4    4    3    4\n3     4     4     4    4    4    4    4    4\n4     2     3     3    4    4    2    4    4\n5     4     3     3    4    3    4    3    3\n6     3     4     3    3    4    3    4    4\n\n\nThe outcome of interest here is the Overall rating. Our first aim is to confirm that the eight factors suggested by the subject matter experts represent a satisfactory measurement model (that they reasonably explain the responses to the 22 items), adjusting or refining if needed. Assuming we can confirm a satisfactory measurement model, our second aim is to run a structural model to determine how each factor relates to the overall intention to vote for the party in the next election.\n\n9.2.1 Running and assessing the measurement model\nThe proposed measurement model can be seen in Figure 9.5. In this path diagram, we see the eight latent variables or factors (circles) and how they map to the individual measured items (squares) in the survey using single headed arrows. Here we are making a simplifying assumption that each latent variable influences an independent group of survey items. The diagram also notes that the latent variables may be correlated with each other, as indicated by the double-headed arrows at the top. Dashed-line paths indicate that a specific item will be used to scale the variance of the latent factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Simple path diagram showing proposed measurement model for politics_survey\n\n\n\nThe lavaan package in R is a specialized package for running analysis on latent variables. The function cfa() can be used to perform a confirmatory factor analysis on a specified measurement model. The measurement model can be specified using an appropriately commented and formatted text string as follows. Note the =~ notation, and note also that each factor is defined on a new line.\n\n# define measurement model\n\nmeas_mod &lt;- \"\n# measurement model\nPol =~ Pol1 + Pol2 + Pol3\nHab =~ Hab1 + Hab2 + Hab3\nLoc =~ Loc1 + Loc2 + Loc3\nEnv =~ Env1 + Env2\nInt =~ Int1 + Int2\nPers =~ Pers1 + Pers2 + Pers3\nNat =~ Nat1 + Nat2 + Nat3\nEco =~ Eco1 + Eco2\n\"\n\nWith the measurement model defined, the confirmatory factor analysis can be run and a summary viewed. The lavaan summary functions used in this section produce quite large outputs. We will proceed to highlight which parts of this output are important in interpreting and refining the model.\n\nlibrary(lavaan)\n\ncfa_meas_mod &lt;- lavaan::cfa(model = meas_mod, data =

is a large set of results, but we can focus in on some important parameters to examine. First, we note that the results did not come attached to a warning. One particular warning to look out for relates to the covariance matrix being non-positive definite. This renders some of the attempted measurement invalid and is usually caused by too small a sample size for the complexity of the measurement model. Since we did not receive this warning, we can proceed safely.\nSecond, we examine the fit statistics. Numerous statistics are reported2, but for larger samples such as this data set, the following measures should be examined:\n\nCFI and TLI, which compare the proposed model to a baseline (null or random) model to determine if it is better. Ideally we look for both of these measures to exceed 0.95. We see that our measurement model comes very close to meeting these criteria.\nRMSEA should ideally be less than 0.06, which is met by our measurement model.\nSRMR should ideally be less than 0.08, which is met by our measurement model.\n\nFinally, the parameter estimates for the latent variables should be examined. In particular the Std.all column which is similar to standardized regression coefficients. These parameters are commonly known as factor loadings—they can be interpreted as the extent to which the item response is explained by the proposed latent variable. In general, factor loadings of 0.7 or above are considered reasonable. Factor loadings less than this may be introducing unacceptable measurement error. One option if this occurs is to drop the item completely from the measurement model, or to explore an alternative measurement model with the item assigned to another latent variable. In any case the analyst will need to balance these considerations against the need to have factors measured against multiple items wherever possible in order to minimize other aspects of measurement error.\nIn our case we could consider dropping Pol3, Loc1, Pers1 and Nat3 from the measurement model as they have factor loadings of less than 0.7 and are in factors that contain three items. We will fit this revised measurement model, and rather than printing the entire output again, we will focus here on our CFI, TLI, RMSEA and SRMR statistics to see if they have improved. It is advisable, however, that factor loadings are also checked, especially where primary items that scale the variance of latent factors have been removed.\n\nmeas_mod_revised &lt;- \"\n# measurement model\nPol =~ Pol1 + Pol2\nHab =~ Hab1 + Hab2 + Hab3\nLoc =~ Loc2 + Loc3\nEnv =~ Env1 + Env2\nInt =~ Int1 + Int2\nPers =~ Pers2 + Pers3\nNat =~ Nat1 + Nat2\nEco =~ Eco1 + Eco2\n\"\n\ncfa_meas_mod_rev &lt;- lavaan::cfa(model = meas_mod_revised, \n                                data = politics_survey)\n\nfits &lt;- lavaan::fitmeasures(cfa_meas_mod_rev)\n\nfits[c(\"cfi\", \"tli\", \"rmsea\", \"srmr\")]\n\n       cfi        tli      rmsea       srmr \n0.97804888 0.96719394 0.03966962 0.02736629 \n\n\nWe now see that our measurement model comfortably meets all fit requirements. In our case we chose to completely drop four items from the model. Analysts may wish to experiment with relaxing criteria on dropping items, or on reassigning items to other factors to achieve a good balance between fit and factor measurement reliability.\n\n\n9.2.2 Running and interpreting the structural model\nWith a satisfactory measurement model, the structural model is a simple regression formula. The sem() function in lavaan can be used to perform a full structural equation model including the measurement model and structural model. Like for cfa(), an extensive output can be expected from this function, but assuming that our measurement model is satisfactory, our key interest is now in the structural model elements of this output.\n\n# define full SEM using revised measurement model\nfull_sem &lt;- \"\n# measurement model\nPol =~ Pol1 + Pol2\nHab =~ Hab1 + Hab2 + Hab3\nLoc =~ Loc2 + Loc3\nEnv =~ Env1 + Env2\nInt =~ Int1

are standardized estimates which can be approximately interpreted as the proportion of the variance of the outcome that is explained by each factor. Here we can make the following interpretations:\n\nPolicies, habit and interest in local issues represent the three strongest drivers of likelihood of voting for the party at the next election, and explain approximately 70% of the overall variance in the outcome.\nInterest in national or international issues, and interest in the economy each have no significant relationship with likelihood to vote for the party at the next election.\nInterest in the environment has a significant negative relationship with likelihood to vote for the party at the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Path diagram for full structural equation model on politics_survey\n\n\n\nThe full structural equation model can be seen in Figure 9.6. This simple example illustrates the value of structural equation modeling in both reducing the dimensions of a complex regression problem and in developing more intuitive and interpretable results for stakeholders. The underlying theory of latent variable modeling, and its implementation in the lavaan package, offer much more flexibility and parameter control options than illustrated here and further exploration is highly recommended. Bartholomew, Knott, and Moustaki (2011) and Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2004) are excellent resources for a deeper study of the theory and a wider range of case examples.\n\n\n9.2.3 Structural equation models using Python\nThe semopy package is a specialized package for the implementation of Structural Equation Models in Python, and its implementation is very similar to the lavaan package in R. However, its reporting is not as intuitive compared to lavaan. A full tutorial is available here. Here is an example of how to run the same model as that studied in Section 9.2 using semopy.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom semopy import Model\n\n\n# get data\nurl = \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/politics_survey.csv\"\npolitics_survey = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n\n# define full measurement and structural model\nmeasurement_model = \"\"\"\n# measurement model\nPol =~ Pol1 + Pol2\nHab =~ Hab1 + Hab2 + Hab3\nLoc =~ Loc2 + Loc3\nEnv =~ Env1 + Env2\nInt =~ Int1 + Int2\nPers =~ Pers2 + Pers3\nNat =~ Nat1 + Nat2\nEco =~ Eco1 + Eco2\n\n# structural model\nOverall ~ Pol + Hab + Loc + Env + Int + Pers + Nat + Eco\n\"\"\"\n\nfull_model = Model(measurement_model)\n\n\n# fit model to data and inspect\nfull_model.fit(politics_survey)\n\nThen to inspect the results:\n\n# inspect the results of SEM (first few rows)\nfull_model.inspect().head()\n\n   lval op rval  Estimate  Std.

Subject matter experts have grouped the items into hypothesized latent factors as follows:\n\nHappiness is an overall measure of the employees current sentiment about their job.\nItems beginning with Ben relate to employment benefits.\nItems beginning with Work relate to the general work environment.\nItems beginning with Man relate to perceptions of management.\nItems beginning with Car relate to perceptions of career prospects.\n\n\nWrite out the proposed measurement model, defining the latent factors in terms of the measured items.\nRun a confirmatory factor analysis on the proposed measurement model. Examine the fit and the factor loadings.\nExperiment with the removal of measured items from the measurement model in order to improve the overall fit.\nOnce satisfied with the fit of the measurement model, run a full structural equation model on the data.\nInterpret the results of the structural model. Which factors appear most related to overall employee sentiment? Approximately what proportion of the variance in overall sentiment does the model explain?\nIf you dropped measured items from your measurement model, experiment with assigning them to other factors to see if this improves the fit of the model.

    "title": "10  Survival Analysis for Modeling Singular Events Over Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1 Tracking and illustrating survival rates over the study period\nIn previous chapters, the outcomes we have been modeling have or have not occurred at a particular point in time following when the input variables were measured. For example, in Chapter 4 input variables were measured in the first three years of an education program and the outcome was measured at the end of the fourth year. In many situations, the outcome we are interested in is a singular event that can occur at any time following when the input variables were measured, can occur at a different time for different individuals, and once it has occurred it cannot reoccur or repeat. In medical studies, death can occur or the onset of a disease can be diagnosed at any time during the study period. In employment contexts, an attrition event can occur at various times throughout the year.\nAn obvious and simple way to deal with this would be to simply agree to look at a specific point in time and measure whether or not the event had occurred at that point, for example, ‘How many employees had left at the three-year point?’. Such an approach allows us to use standard generic regression models like those studied in previous chapters. But this approach has limitations.\nFirstly, we are only able to infer conclusions about the likelihood of the event having occurred as at the end of the period of study. We cannot make inferences about the likelihood of the event throughout the period of study. Being able to say that attrition is twice as likely for certain types of individuals at any time throughout the three years is more powerful than merely saying that attrition is twice as likely at the three-year point.\nSecondly, our sample size is constrained by the state of our data at the end of the period of study. Therefore if we lose track of an individual after two years and six months, that observation needs to be dropped from our data set if we are focused only on the three-year point. Wherever possible, loss of data is something a statistician will want to avoid as it affects the accuracy and statistical power of inferences, and also means research effort was wasted.\nSurvival analysis is a general term for the modeling of a time-associated binary non-repeated outcome, usually involving an understanding of the comparative risk of that outcome between two or more different groups of interest. There are two common components in an elementary survival analysis, as follows:\nThose seeking a more in depth treatment of survival analysis should consult texts on its use in medical/clinical contexts, and a recommended source is Collett (2015). In this chapter we will use a walkthrough example to illustrate a typical use of survival analysis in a people analytics context.\nThe job_retention data set shows the results of a study of around 3,800 individuals employed in various fields of employment over a one-year period. At the beginning of the study, the individuals were asked to rate their sentiment towards their job. These individuals were then followed up monthly for a year to determine if they were still working in the same job or had left their job for a substantially different job. If an individual was not successfully followed up in a given month, they were no longer followed up for the remainder of the study period.\nFor this walkthrough example, the particular fields we are interested in are:\nIn our example, we are defining ‘survival’ as ‘remaining in substantially the same job’‍. We can regard the starting point as month 0, and we are following up in each of months 1 through 12. For a given month \\(i\\), we can define a survival rate \\(S_i\\) as follows\n\\[\nS_i = S_{i - 1}(1 - \\frac{l_i}{n_i})\n\\] where \\(l_i\\) is the number reported as left in month \\(i\\), and \\(n_i\\) is the number still in substantially the same job after month \\(i - 1\\), with \\(S_0 = 1\\).\nThe survival package in R allows easy construction of survival rates on data in a similar format to that in our job_retention data set. A survival object is created using the Surv() function to track the survival rate at each time period.\nlibrary(survival)\n\n# create survival object with event as 'left' and time as 'month'\nretention &lt;- Surv(event = job_retention$left, \n                  time = job_retention$month)\n\n# view unique values of retention\nunique(retention)\n\n [1]  1  12+  5   2   3   6   8   4   8+  4+ 11  10   9   7+  5+  3+  7   9+ 11+\n[20] 12  10+  6+  2+  1+\nWe can see that our survival object records the month at which the individual had left their job if they are recorded as having done so in the data set. If not, the object records the last month at which there was a record of the individual, appended with a ‘+’ to indicate that this was the last record available.\nThe survfit() function allows us to calculate Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival for different groups in the data so that we can compare them. We can do this using our usual formula notation but using a survival object as the outcome. Let’s take a look at survival by gender.\n# kaplan-meier estimates of survival by gender\nkmestimate_gender &lt;- survival::survfit(\n  formula = Surv(event = left, time = month) ~ gender, \n  data = job_retention\n)\n\nsummary(kmestimate_gender)\n\nCall: survfit(formula = Surv(event = left, time = month) ~ gender, \n    data = job_retention)\n\n                gender=F \n time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI\n    1   1167       7    0.994 0.00226        0.990        0.998\n    2   1140      24    0.973 0.00477        0.964        0.982\n    3   1102      45    0.933 0.00739        0.919        0.948\n    4   1044      45    0.893 0.00919        0.875        0.911\n    5    987      30    0.866 0.01016        0.846        0.886\n    6    940      51    0.819 0.01154        0.797        0.842\n    7    882      43    0.779 0.01248        0.755        0.804\n    8    830      47    0.735 0.01333        0.709        0.762\n    9    770      40    0.697 0.01394        0.670        0.725\n   10    718      21    0.676 0.01422        0.649        0.705\n   11    687      57    0.620 0.01486        0.592        0.650\n   12    621      17    0.603 0.01501        0.575        0.633\n\n                gender=M \n time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI\n    1   2603      17    0.993 0.00158        0.990        0.997\n    2   2559      66    0.968 0.00347        0.961        0.975\n    3   2473     100    0.929 0.00508        0.919        0.939\n    4   2360      86    0.895 0.00607        0.883        0.907\n    5   2253      56    0.873 0.00660        0.860        0.886\n    6   2171     120    0.824 0.00756        0.810        0.839\n    7   2029      85    0.790 0.00812        0.774        0.806\n    8   1916     114    0.743 0.00875        0.726        0.760\n    9   1782      96    0.703 0.00918        0.685        0.721\n   10   1661      50    0.682 0.00938        0.664        0.700\n   11   1590     101    0.638 0.00972        0.620        0.658\n   12   1460      36    0.623 0.00983        0.604        0.642\nWe can see that the n.risk, n.event and survival columns for each group correspond to the \\(n_i\\), \\(l_i\\) and \\(S_i\\) in our formula above and that the confidence intervals for each survival rate are given.

    "text": "10.2 Cox proportional hazard regression models\nLet’s imagine that we have a survival outcome that we are modeling for a population over a time \\(t\\), and we are interested in how a set of input variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\) influences that survival outcome. Given that our survival outcome is a binary variable, we can model survival at any time \\(t\\) as a binary logistic regression. We define \\(h(t)\\) as the proportion who have not survived at time \\(t\\), called the hazard function, and based on our work in Chapter 5:\n\\[\nh(t) = h_0(t)e^{\\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p}\n\\] where \\(h_0(t)\\) is a base or intercept hazard at time \\(t\\), and \\(\\beta_i\\) is the coefficient associated with \\(x_i\\) .\nNow let’s imagine we are comparing the hazard for two different individuals \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) from our population. We make an assumption that our hazard curves \\(h^A(t)\\) for individual \\(A\\) and \\(h^B(t)\\) for individual \\(B\\) are always proportional to each other and never cross—this is called the proportional hazard assumption. Under this assumption, we can conclude that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{h^B(t)}{h^A(t)} &= \\frac{h_0(t)e^{\\beta_1x_1^B + \\beta_2x_2^B + \\dots + \\beta_px_p^B}}{h_0(t)e^{\\beta_1x_1^A + \\beta_2x_2^A + \\dots + \\beta_px_p^A}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_1(x_1^B-x_1^A) + \\beta_2(x_2^B-x_2^A) + \\dots \\beta_p(x_p^B-x_p^A)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that there is no \\(t\\) in our final equation. The important observation here is that the hazard for person B relative to person A is constant and independent of time. This allows us to take a complicating factor out of our model. It means we can model the effect of input variables on the hazard without needing to account for changes over times, making this model very similar in interpretation to a standard binomial regression model.\n\n10.2.1 Running a Cox proportional hazard regression model\nA Cox proportional hazard model can be run using the coxph() function in the survival package, with the outcome as a survival object.

Here we can conclude that working in Finance or Health is associated with a significantly greater likelihood of leaving over the period studied, and that higher sentiment is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of leaving.\nRelative odds ratios associated with each input variable. For example, a single extra point in sentiment reduces the odds of leaving by ~11%. A single less point increases the odds of leaving by ~12%. Confidence intervals for the coefficients are also provided.\nThree statistical tests on the null hypothesis that the coefficients are zero. This null hypothesis is rejected by all three tests which can be interpreted as meaning that the model is significant.\n\nImportantly, as well as statistically validating that sentiment has a significant effect on retention, our Cox model has allowed us to control for possible mediating variables. We can now say that sentiment has a significant effect on retention even for individuals of the same gender, in the same field and at the same level.\n\n\n10.2.2 Checking the proportional hazard assumption\nNote that we mentioned in the previous section a critical assumption for our Cox proportional hazard model to be valid, called the proportional hazard assumption. As always, it is important to check this assumption before finalizing any inferences or conclusions from your model.\nThe most popular test of this assumption uses a residual known as a Schoenfeld residual, which would be expected to be independent of time if the proportional hazard assumption holds. The cox.zph() function in the survival package runs a statistical test on the null hypothesis that the Schoenfeld residuals are independent of time. The test is conducted on every input variable and on the model as a whole, and a significant result would reject the proportional hazard assumption.\n\n(ph_check &lt;- survival::cox.zph(cox_model))\n\n           chisq df    p\ngender     0.726  1 0.39\nfield      6.656  5 0.25\nlevel      2.135  2 0.34\nsentiment  1.828  1 0.18\nGLOBAL    11.156  9 0.27\n\n\nIn our case, we can confirm that the proportional hazard assumption is not rejected. The ggcoxzph() function in the survminer package takes the result of the cox.zph() check and allows a graphical check by plotting the residuals against time, as seen in Figure 10.2.\n\n\n\n\nsurvminer::ggcoxzph(ph_check, \n                    font.main = 10, \n                    font.x = 10, \n                    font.y = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Schoenfeld test on proportional hazard assumption for cox_model",

    "text": "10.3 Frailty models\nWe noticed in our example in the previous section that certain fields of employment appeared to have a significant effect on the attrition hazard. It is therefore possible that different fields of employment have different base hazard functions, and we may wish to take this into account in determining if input variables have a significant relationship with attrition. This is analogous to a mixed model which we looked at in Section 9.1.\nIn this case we would apply a random intercept effect to the base hazard function \\(h_0(t)\\) according to the field of employment of an individual, in order to take this into account in our modeling. This kind of model is called a frailty model, taken from the clinical context, where different groups of patients may have different frailties (background risks of death).\nThere are many variants of how frailty models are run in the clinical context (see Collett (2015) for an excellent exposition of these), but the main application of a frailty model in people analytics would be to adapt a Cox proportional hazard model to take into account different background risks of the hazard event occurring among different groups in the data. This is called a shared frailty model. The frailtypack R package allows various frailty models to be run with relative ease. This is how we would run a shared frailty model on our job_retention data to take account of the different background attrition risk for the different fields of employment.\n\nlibrary(frailtypack)\n\n(frailty_model &lt;- frailtypack::frailtyPenal(\n  formula = Surv(event = left, time = month) ~ gender + \n    level + sentiment + cluster(field),\n  data = job_retention,\n  n.knots = 12, \n  kappa = 10000\n))\n\n\nBe patient.

    "title": "11  Power Analysis to Estimate Required Sample Sizes for Modeling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "11.1 Errors, effect sizes and statistical power\nIn the vast majority of situations in people analytics, researchers and analysts have limited control over the size of their samples. The most common situation is, of course, that analyses are run with whatever data can be gleaned and cleaned in the time available. At the same time, as we have seen in all of our previous work, even if a certain difference might exist in real life in the populations being studied, it is by no means certain that a specific analysis on samples from these populations will elucidate that difference. Whether that difference is visible depends on the statistical properties of the samples used. Therefore, researchers and analysts are living in the reality that when they conduct inferential analysis, the usefulness of their work depends to a very large degree on the samples they have available.\nThis suggests that a conscientious analyst would be well advised to do some up-front work to determine if their samples have a chance of yielding results that are of some inferential value. In a practical context, however, this is only partly true (and that is an important reason why this chapter has been left towards the end of this book). Estimating required sample sizes is an imprecise science. Although the mathematics suggest that in theory it should be precise, in reality we are guessing most of the inputs to the mathematics. In many cases we are so clueless about those inputs that we move into the realms of pure speculation and produce ranges of required sample sizes that are so wide as to be fairly meaningless in practice.\nThat said, there are situations where conducting power analysis—that is, analysis of the required statistical properties of samples in order to have a certain minimum probability of observing a true difference—makes sense. Power analysis is an important element of experimental design. Experiments in people analytics usually take one of two forms:\nBoth prospective and retrospective experiments can involve a lot of work—either in setting up experiments or in extracting data from history. There is a natural question as to whether the chances of success justify the required resources and effort. Before proceeding in these cases, it is sensible to get a point of view on the likely power of the experiment and what level of sample size might be needed in order to establish a meaningful inference. For this reason, power analysis is a common component of research proposals in the medical or social sciences.\nPower analysis is a relatively blunt instrument whose primary value is to make sure that substantial effort is not being wasted on foolhardy research. If the analyst already has reasonably available data and wants to test for the effect of a certain phenomenon, the most direct approach is to just go and run the appropriate model assuming that it is relatively straightforward to do so. Power analysis should only be considered if there is clearly some substantial labor involved in the proposed modeling work.\nBefore looking at practical ways to conduct power tests on proposed experiments, let’s review an example of the logical and mathematical principles behind power testing, so that we understand what the results of power tests mean. Recall from Section 3.3 the logical mechanisms for testing hypotheses of statistical difference. Given data on samples of two groups in a population, the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is the hypothesis that a difference does not exist between the groups in the overall population. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we entertain the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) that a difference may exist between the groups in the population.\nRecall also that we use the statistical properties of the samples to make inferences about the null hypothesis based on statistical likelihood. This means that four possible situations can occur when we run hypothesis tests:\nStatistical power refers to the fourth situation and is the probability that \\(H_0\\) is rejected given that \\(H_1\\) is true. Statistical power depends at a minimum on three criteria:\nAs an example to illustrate the mathematical relationship between these criteria, let’s assume that we run an experiment on a group of employees of size \\(n\\) where we introduce a new benefit and then test their satisfaction levels before and after its introduction. As a statistic of a random variable, we can expect the mean difference in satisfaction to have a normal distribution. Let \\(\\mu_0\\) be the mean of the population under the null hypothesis and let \\(\\mu_1\\) be the mean of the population under the alternative hypothesis. Now let’s assume that in our sample we observe a mean satisfaction of \\(\\mu^*\\) after the experiment. Recall from Chapter 3 that to meet a statistical significance standard of \\(\\alpha\\), we will need \\(\\mu^*\\) to be greater than a certain multiple of the standard error \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) above \\(\\mu_0\\) based on the normal distribution. Let’s call that multiple \\(z_{\\alpha}\\). Therefore, we can say that the statistical power of our hypothesis test is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Power} &= P(\\mu^* &gt; \\mu_0 + z_{\\alpha}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\vert{\\mu = \\mu_1}) \\\\\n&= P(\\frac{\\mu^* - \\mu_1}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} &gt; -\\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} + z_{\\alpha}\\vert{\\mu = \\mu_1}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\Phi(-\\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} + z_{\\alpha}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\Phi(-\\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{n} + z_{\\alpha}) \\\\\n&=  1 - \\Phi(-d\\sqrt{n} + z_{\\alpha})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative normal probability distribution function, and \\(d = \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0}{\\sigma}\\) is known as Cohen’s effect size. Therefore, we can see that power depends on a measure of the observed effect size between our two samples (defined as Cohen’s \\(d\\)) the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and the sample size \\(n\\)1.\nThe reader may immediately observe that many of these measures are not known at the typical point at which we would wish to do a power analysis. We can assert a minimum level of statistical power that we would wish for—usually this is somewhere between 0.8 and 0.9. We can also assert our \\(\\alpha\\). But at a point of experimental design, we usually do not know the sample size and we do not know what difference would be observed in that sample (the effect size). This implies that we are dealing with a single equation with more than one unknown, and this means that there is no unique solution2. Practically speaking, looking at ranges of values will be common in power analysis.",

    "text": "11.2 Power analysis for simple hypothesis tests\nUsually we will run power analyses to get a sense of required sample sizes. Given the observations on unknowns in the previous section, we will have to assert certain possible statistical results in order to estimate required sample sizes. Most often, we will need to suggest the observed effect size in order to obtain the minimum sample size for that effect size to return a statistically significant result at a desired level of statistical power.\nUsing our example from the previous section, let’s assume that we would see a ‘medium’ effect size on our samples. Cohen’s Rule of Thumb for \\(d\\) states that \\(d = 0.2\\) is a small effect size, \\(d = 0.5\\) a medium effect size and \\(d = 0.8\\) a large effect size. We can use the wp.t() function from the WebPower package in R to do a power analysis on a paired two-sample \\(t\\)-test and return a minimum required sample size. We can assume \\(d = 0.5\\) and that we require a power of 0.8—that is, we want an 80% probability that the test will return an accurate rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\nlibrary(WebPower)\n\n# get minimum n for power of 0.8\n(n_test &lt;- WebPower::wp.t(d = 0.5, p = 0.8, type = \"paired\"))\n\nPaired t-test\n\n           n   d alpha power\n    33.36713 0.5  0.05   0.8\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\nURL: http://psychstat.org/ttest\n\n\nThis tells us that we need an absolute minimum of 34 individuals in our sample for an effect size of 0.5 to return a significant difference at an alpha of 0.05 with 80% probability. Alternatively we can test the power of a specific proposed sample size.\n\n# get power for n of 40\n(p_test &lt;- WebPower::wp.t(n1 = 40, d = 0.5, type = \"paired\"))\n\nPaired t-test\n\n     n   d alpha     power\n    40 0.5  0.05 0.8693981\n\nNOTE: n is number of *pairs*\nURL: http://psychstat.org/ttest\n\n\nThis tells us that a minimum sample size of 40 would result in a power of 0.87. A similar process can be used to plot the dependence between power and sample size under various conditions as in Figure 11.1. This is known as a power curve.\n\n\n\n\n# test a range of sample sizes\nsample_sizes &lt;- 20:100\npower &lt;- WebPower::wp.t(n1 = sample_sizes, d = 0.5, type = \"paired\")\n\nplot(power)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Plot of power against sample size for a paired t-test\n\n\n\nWe can see a ‘sweet spot’ of approximately 40–60 minimum required participants, and a diminishing return on statistical power over and above this. Similarly we can plot a proposed minimum sample size against a range of effect sizes as in Figure 11.2.\n\n\n\n\n# test a range of effect sizes\neffect_sizes &lt;- 2:8/10\nsamples &lt;- WebPower::wp.t(n1 = rep(40, 7), \n                          d = effect_sizes, \n                          type = \"paired\")\nplot(samples$d, samples$power, type = \"b\",\n     xlab = \"Effect size\", ylab = \"Power\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Plot of power against effect size for a paired t-test\n\n\n\nSimilar power test variants exist for other common simple hypothesis tests. Let’s assume that we want to institute a screening test in a recruiting process, and we want to validate this test by running it on a random set of employees with the aim of proving that the test score has a significant non-zero correlation with job performance.

Most commonly this will be a comparison of a ‘full’ fitted model involving specific input variables compared to a ‘reduced’ model with fewer input variables (often a random variance model with no input variables).\nThe \\(f^2\\) statistic is defined as follows:\n\\[\nf^2 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{full}}^2 - R_{\\mathrm{reduced}}^2}{1 - R_{\\mathrm{full}}^2}\n\\] where the formula refers to the \\(R^2\\) fit statistics for the two models being compared. As an example, imagine we already know that GPA in college has a significant relationship with job performance, and we wish to determine if our proposed screening test had incremental validity on top of knowing college GPA. We might run two linear regression models, one relating job performance to GPA, and another relating job performance to both GPA and screening test score. Assuming we would observe a relatively small effect size for our screening test, we assume \\(f^2 = 0.05\\)4, we can plot sample size against power in determining whether the two models are significantly different.

    "text": "11.4 Power analysis for log-likelihood regression models\nIn Chapter 5, we reviewed how measures of fit for log-likelihood models are still the subject of some debate. Given this, it is unsurprising that measures of effect size for log-likelihood models are not well established. The most well-developed current method appeared in Demidenko (2007), and works when we want to do a power test on a single input variable \\(x\\) using the Wald test on the significance of model coefficients (see Section 7.3.2 for a reminder of the Wald test).\nIn this method, the statistical power of a significance test on the input variable \\(x\\) is determined using multiple inputs as follows:\n\nThe likelihood of a positive outcome when \\(x = 0\\) is used to determine the intercept (p0 in the code below).\nThe likelihood of a positive outcome when \\(x = 1\\) is then used to determine the regression coefficient for \\(x\\) (p1 in the code below).\nA distribution for \\(x\\) is inputted (family below) and the parameters of that distribution are also entered (parameter below). For example, if the distribution is assumed to be normal then the mean and standard deviation would be entered as parameters.\nThis information is fed into the Wald test, and the power for specific sample sizes is calculated.\n\nFor example, let’s assume that we wanted to determine if our new screening test had a significant effect on promotion likelihood by running an experiment on employees who were being considered for promotion. We assume that our screening test is scored on a percentile scale and has a mean of 53 and a standard deviation of 21. We know that approximately 50% of those being considered for promotion will be promoted, and we believe that the screening test may have a small effect whereby those who score zero would still have a 40% chance of promotion and every additional point scored would increase this chance by 0.2 percentage points.

    "text": "11.5 Power analysis for hierarchical regression models\nPower tests for explicit hierarchical models usually originate from the context of the design of clinical trials, which not only concern themselves with the entire sample size of a study but also need to determine the split of that sample between treatment and control. It is rare that power analysis would need to be conducted for hierarchical models in people analytics but the technology is available in the WebPower package to explore this.\nCluster randomized trials are trials where it is not possible to allocate individuals randomly to treatment or control groups and where entire clusters have been allocated at random instead. This creates substantial additional complexity in understanding statistical power and required sample sizes. The wp.crt2arm() function in WebPower supports power analysis on 2-arm trials (treatment and control), and the wp.crt3arm() function supports power analysis on 3-arm trials (Two different treatments and a control).\nMultisite randomized trials are trials where individuals are assigned to treatment or control groups at random, but where these individuals also belong to different clusters which are important in modeling—for example, they may be members of clinical groups based on pre-existing conditions, or they may be being treated in different hospitals or outpatient facilities. Again, this makes for a substantially more complex calculation of statistical power. The wp.mrt2arm() and wp.mrt3arm() functions offer support for this.\nPower tests are also available for structural equation models. This involves comparing a more ‘complete’ structural model to a ‘subset’ model where some of the coefficients from the more ‘complete’ model are set to zero. Such power tests can be valuable when structural models have been applied previously on responses to survey instruments and there is an intention to test alternative models in the future. They can provide information on required future survey participation and response rates in order to establish whether the improved fit can be established for the alternative models.\nThere are two approaches to power tests for structural equation models, using a chi square test and a root mean squared error (RMSEA) approach. Both of these methods take a substantial number of input parameters, consistent with the complexity of structural equation model parameters and the various alternatives for measuring fit of these models. The chi square test approach is implemented by the wp.sem.chisq() function, and the RMSEA approach is implemented by the wp.sem.rmsea() function in WebPower.",

It will also make it easy for you to share your work with others (for example by putting it in a Github repository), which will allow you to collaborate, discuss and open your work to critique. If you are starting out on your analytics journey, exposing your work to others is one of the best ways to learn. If you are more experienced, then there are others that will undoubtedly benefit from seeing how you went about solving these problems.\nGraduate salary levels are important economic indicators of the value of tertiary education. They can provide important insight about the value of education to employers or to the economy as a whole. When studied in detail they can highlight which particular disciplines have higher or lower levels of demand for graduates, and they can be important factors in determining what subjects or majors students choose to specialize in.\nGovernment agencies and educational institutions will analyze graduate salaries regularly to help critique or validate policy or strategy.

    "section": "12.2 Analyzing a recruiting process",
    "text": "12.2 Analyzing a recruiting process\nOrganizations are often very interested in analyzing data from recruiting processes, usually with a couple of goals in mind. Firstly, there is an interest in whether the process is efficient and effective. Secondly, there is an interest in whether the process is fair to different groups and a foundation for the recruiting of a sufficiently diverse set of employees.\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of a recruiting process can depend heavily on how it is organized, what methods are used and whether those methods are helpful in determining hiring decisions. Statistics from individual elements of the process such as interviews or assessments are often studied. Models can be built to determine which elements influence the decision to hire or not to hire. In an ideal world, some sort of future job performance outcome would be particularly useful in studying the efficiency and effectiveness of a recruiting process, but often this is a very difficult thing to do, especially if the process is very selective. Hiring only a small proportion of applicants usually results in a statistical phenomenon known as range restriction, where the statistics of those hired fall in a very narrow range that makes useful analysis extremely challenging. For this reason, many organizations focus primarily on the final hiring decision as an outcome of interest.\nUnderstanding fairness in a recruiting process usually involves studying how the statistics of that process differ between subgroups of interest and whether any of the differences are significant enough to infer potential bias. Understanding whether these differences are attributable to a particular element of the process, whether it be a test or the rating behaviors of interviewers, is also important in determining whether specific action can be taken to remedy the situation.\n\n12.2.1 The recruiting data set\nThe recruiting data set contains information on 966 applicants who went through the final stages of a recruiting process for graduate positions at a large international financial services company. The recruiting process operates as follows:\n\nApplications are screened according to a number of criteria, including their SAT scores and their undergraduate GPA as well as an online aptitude test they are requested to take and numerous other judgments made by the individuals screening the applications.\nApplicants who pass the screening stage are invited for three interviews, two of them with line managers and a third with a human resources professional. Different line managers or HR professionals conduct the interviews on different interview days. Each interviewer independently gives an applicant a score on a Likert scale of 1–5 indicating increasing positive sentiment.\nInterviewers and human resources professionals gather to discuss each case and make a final decision on whether to hire or not to hire. All the information used in screening and evaluating applicants is made available to decision makers during this discussion.\n\nLoad the recruiting data set via the peopleanalyticsdata package or download it from the internet3. The fields in the recruiting data set are as follows:\n\ngender is the gender of the applicant.\nsat is the SAT score of the applicant.\ngpa is the Undergraduate GPA of the applicant.\napttest is the score on the aptitude test given to the applicant.\nint1 is the rating of the first line manager interviewer.\nint2 is the rating of the second line manager interviewer.\nint3 is the rating of the human resources interviewer.\nhired is a binary indicator of whether a decision was made to hire the applicant.\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Discussion questions\n\nConsidering the way the recruiting process works, what kinds of inferential analysis or modeling would you be interested in applying to help understand its efficiency and effectiveness?\nWhat kind of model is most appropriate for explaining the hired outcome?\nOne of your stakeholders is suggesting that the aptitude test is a waste of time and that the information it provides can already be gleaned from the applicants’ SAT scores and GPA. What kind of statistical analysis or model would help you confirm or reject this?\nDo you think that collinearity might pose a risk in this data? If so, what variables would concern you?\nWhat kind of hypothesis test would you use to determine if the hiring outcome may be different by gender?\nWhat kind of hypothesis test would you use to determine if the aptitude test score may be different by gender?\nHow would you go about determining if any gender difference in the hiring outcome can be attributed to a specific part of the process?\n\n\n\n12.2.3 Data exercises\n\nPerform an exploratory data analysis on the recruiting data set. Be sure to convert data to the best type for your purposes.\nDevelop a model to test how the aptitude test results are explained by an applicant’s SAT and GPA. What can you conclude from this? Have you considered possible collinearity in this model?\nDevelop a model to explain how all the inputs in the hiring decision (interview ratings, aptitude test, SAT and GPA) influence the hiring decision. Reduce this to the most parsimonious model you are comfortable with. What can you conclude from this model about the role of the different elements of the recruiting process in the final hiring decision?\nTest whether there is a statistically significant difference in the hiring outcome for males versus females.\nBy adding gender into your model from Data Exercise 3, determine what element or elements of the recruiting process may be related to any differences in gender in the hiring outcome.",

    "text": "12.3 Analyzing the drivers of performance ratings\nIn many organizations and for many job types, promotion and performance ratings are the primary indicators of the success of employees. However, promotion is not always available to employees and can be very dependent on role and timing. Since performance ratings are usually generated on a regular basis, it is usually these that garner the most attention in the analysis of success.\nHowever, performance ratings are not perfect indicators of reality. They are usually the result of some judgment from one or more evaluators. Part of that judgment will be informed by data and part will be informed by contextual considerations or personal preferences outside of the data. Therefore it is frequently of interest to analyze performance ratings as the outcome of a decision making process. Such analysis can inform us as to what parts of the evaluation process are operating as intended and what parts are not. Multivariate models around performance can help us understand the degree to which the evaluation process is data driven, the degree to which unfairness might exist in some evaluation decisions and what might be the source of that unfairness.\n\n12.3.1 The employee_performance data set\nThe employee_performance data set contains data on the most recent performance evaluations of 366 salespeople in a technology company. Each employee is evaluated by their manager, who considers certain performance indicators together with their own judgment and awards a performance rating from 1 to 3, where 1 means ‘Needs improvement’, 2 means ‘Performing well’ and 3 means ‘Outstanding’.\nLoad the employee_performance data set via the peopleanalyticsdata package or download it from the internet4. The fields in the employee_performance data set are as follows:\n\nsales: The sales in millions of dollars made by the salesperson during the evaluation period\nnew_customers: The number of new customers acquired by the salesperson during the evaluation period\nregion: The region that the salesperson operates in: North, South, East or West\ngender: The gender of the salesperson\nrating: The performance rating awarded by the manager\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Discussion questions\n\nWhat hypothesis test should be used to determine if there is a significant relationship between sales and performance rating?\nWhat hypothesis test should be used to determine if there is a similar distribution of performance ratings between the four regions?\nWhat type of an outcome is the performance rating? What kind of model is appropriate for explaining what influences performance ratings?\nWhich input variables would you want to be significant and which would you want to be insignificant in your model in order to support an argument that the evaluation process is fair and relevant to the job?\nWhat assumptions would you need to check after you have run your model to have confidence that you can trust your inferences?\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Data exercises\n\nRun separate and appropriate hypothesis tests on each of the input variables to determine if they have a significant effect on the performance outcome.\nPrepare your data for running an appropriate multivariate model to explain the performance outcome. Be sure to convert to appropriate data types.\nRun an appropriate multivariate model to explain the performance outcome. Report on which variables are significant and estimate the effects of the significant variables.\nDetermine and comment on the overall fit and goodness-of-fit of your model. Use this to make a comment on how ‘data driven’ you believe the evaluation process to be.\nPerform appropriate checks on the assumptions of your model. What approach might you take if any of these tests fail?",

    "text": "12.4 Analyzing promotion differences between groups\nAs mentioned in the previous section, promotion is a more challenging outcome to analyze because it can happen at different times for different people or groups. Nevertheless, over certain time periods—usually several years—organizations will be interested in understanding what affects the likelihood of promotion among their employees.\nIt is particularly interesting to compare subgroups of employees that have common characteristics to see if there is a difference in their likelihood of promotion over a specified time period. This is highly analogous to the study of retention or attrition in that promotion can be considered a singular event that can happen to different individuals at different points in time. Like retention or attrition, we are not only interested in whether this event occurred as at the end of a period of time, we are also interested in when it occurred throughout the period.\n\n12.4.1 The promotion data set\nThe promotion data set contains data on 1134 individuals who joined a retailer in an entry-level job, and tracks them for up to eight subsequent years post joining. For each individual the data records whether or not they were promoted, and if so in which year the promotion occurred, where the date of their joining is Year 0. Once promotion occurs, an individual is no longer tracked. If an individual was not promoted, then the year in which the last record occurred is captured.\nLoad the promotion data set via the peopleanalyticsdata package or download it from the internet5. The fields in the data are as follows:\n\ndiverse indicates whether or not the individual is a member of one of the organization’s diversity programs.\nflexible indicates whether the individual worked on a part-time program for at least 6 months.\nstore indicates if the individual joined the company in a retail store position.\npromoted indicates whether the individual was promoted.\nyear indicates the year in which the last record was made of the individual.\n\n\n\n12.4.2 Discussion questions\n\nWhat type of analysis is most appropriate to understand if there is a difference in promotion likelihood for employees who are on flexible hours, in diversity programs or who work in-store?\nWhat type of illustration would you use to show whether each of these three factors individually have an effect on promotion likelihood?\nWhat type of model would be most appropriate to determine the combined effects of all of these factors on promotion likelihood?\nHow would you go about determining whether any differences in promotion likelihood in a given group (such as the flexible working group) is mediated by membership of another group?\nWhat assumptions would you need to check to validate that your analysis is trustworthy?\n\n\n\n12.4.3 Data exercises\n\nRun an exploratory data analysis to understand any general patterns of interest in the data.\nPerform an analysis and generate an appropriate graph to illustrate the impact of flexible working on the likelihood of promotion. Determine if there is a statistically significant effect.\nRepeat this analysis to determine the impact of diversity program membership.\nRun an appropriate multivariate model to determine how all three variables of flexible working, diversity and in-store working affect the likelihood of promotion. Remember to check the assumptions of your model.\nHow would you explain your conclusions? Are there any corrective actions that this analysis might point to?",

    "text": "12.5 Analyzing feedback on learning programs\nAssessing the effectiveness of learning programs remains one of the most challenging problems in people analytics. As with many challenging analytics problems, measurement is the key issue. It is exceptionally difficult to track and measure the impact of learning on the future day-to-day success of the individuals who have had access to it. While it makes sense to try to understand the influence of learning on important outcomes like employment, promotion or attrition, these outcomes can often be too distant, too generic in nature and too influenced by context and other factors to expect specific learning participation to show any meaningful influence on them.\nBecause of the challenges in objectively measuring the impact of learning, analysts often rely on the reaction and feedback of learning participants as an important measure of the success of learning programs. If the content of the program is known to be important to future work and related to future success, and if the participants report that the program was effective for them, then this can create a compelling argument for the success of the program.\n\n12.5.1 The learning data set\nThe learning data set contains 4974 instances of feedback from 326 different participants in a range of learning programs offered by an executive education provider. Each row of data represents the feedback of a specific participant on a specific program that they participated in. Participants were not required to respond to all feedback questions and any question where no response was given is indicated as NA.\nLoad the learning data set via the peopleanalyticsdata package or download it from the internet6. The fields in the learning data set are as follows:\n\nidcode is the unique ID of the participant.\nrec is a binary value indicating whether the participant would recommend the program to others.\nrel is a rating from the participant on the relevance of the program to their work, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.\nfun is a rating on how enjoyable and fun the participant found the program, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High\nclar is a rating from the participant on the clarity of the content and teaching in the program, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.\nhome is a rating from the participant on the quality of the homework or project work in the program, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.\nclass is a rating from the participant on the quality of the overall class who attended the program, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.\nfac is a rating from the participant on the quality of the program faculty and instructors, where 1 is Very Low and 5 is Very High.\n\n\n\n12.5.2 Discussion questions\n\nWhat kind of outcome is the rec column and which kind of model best suits this outcome type?\nDescribe the nature of the hierarchy in this data set.\nDescribe what question we would be answering if we ignored the hierarchy in modeling what influences rec.\nDescribe what question we would be answering if we considered the hierarchy in modeling what influences rec.\nWhat kind of model would you use to explicitly consider this hierarchy in modeling what influences rec? What kinds of parameters would you experiment with in running this model?\nDescribe what you would expect to see in the output of a model that considered the hierarchy in modeling what influences rec.\n\n\n\n12.5.3 Data exercises\n\nPrepare and run a model to determine which elements of feedback influence whether or not the program will be recommended to others.\nPrepare and run a separate model to determine which elements of feedback influence a participant in deciding if they would recommend a program to others.\nExperiment with the model from Data Exercise 2 by adjusting which parameters you model at the participant level.\nDescribe the different outputs of your models from Data Exercises 2 and 3 and how to interpret them.\nCompare the outputs of your models from Data Exercises 2 and 3 to those from Data Exercise 1. How might your conclusions differ between the two modeling approaches?",
