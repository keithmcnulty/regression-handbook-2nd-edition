    "text": "1.1 Why is regression modeling so important in people analytics?\nIn the 19th century, when Francis Galton first used the term ‘regression’ to describe a statistical phenomenon (see Chapter 4), little did he know how important that term would be today. Many of the most powerful tools of statistical inference that we now have at our disposal can be traced back to the types of early analysis that Galton and his contemporaries were engaged in. The sheer number of different regression-related methodologies and variants that are available to researchers and practitioners today is mind-boggling, and there are still rich veins of ongoing research that are focused on defining and refining new forms of regression to tackle new problems.\nNeither could Galton have imagined the advent of the age of data we now live in. Those of us (like me) who entered the world of work even as recently as 20 years ago remember a time when most problems could not be expected to be solved using a data-driven approach, because there simply was no data. Things are very different now, with data being collected and processed all around us and available to use as direct or indirect measures of the phenomena we are interested in.\nAlong with the growth in data that we have seen in recent years, we have also seen a rapid growth in the availability of statistical tools—open source and free to use—that fundamentally change how we go about analytics. Gone are the clunky, complex, repeated steps on calculators or spreadsheets. In their place are lean statistical programming languages that can implement a regression analysis in milliseconds with a single line of code, allowing us to easily run and reproduce multivariate analysis at scale.\nSo given that we have access to well-developed methodology, rich sources of data and readily accessible tools, it is somewhat surprising that many analytics practitioners have a limited knowledge and understanding of regression and its applications. The aim of this book is to encourage inexperienced analytics practitioners to ‘dip their toes’ further into the wide and varied world of regression in order to deliver more targeted and precise insights to their organizations and stakeholders on the problems they are most interested in. While the primary subject matter focus of this book is the analysis of people-related phenomena, the material is easily and naturally transferable to other disciplines. Therefore this book can be regarded as a practical introduction to a wide range of regression methods for any analytics student or practitioner.\nIt is my firm belief that all people analytics professionals should have a strong understanding of regression models and how to implement and interpret them in practice, and my aim with this book is to provide those who need it with help in getting there. In this chapter we will set the scene for the technical learning in the remainder of the book by outlining the relevance of regression models in people analytics practice. We also touch on some general inferential modeling theory to set a context for later chapters, and we provide a preview of the contents, structure and learning objectives of this book.\nPeople analytics involves the study of the behaviors and characteristics of people or groups in relation to important business, organizational or institutional outcomes. This can involve both qualitative methods and quantitative methods, but if data is available related to a particular topic of interest, then quantitative methods are almost always considered important. With such a specific focus on outcomes, any analyst working in people analytics will frequently need to model these outcomes both to understand what influences them and to potentially predict them in the future.\nModeling an outcome with the primary goal of understanding what influences it can be quite a different matter to modeling an outcome with the primary goal of predicting if it will happen in the future. If we need to understand what influences an outcome, we need to get inside a model and construct a formula or structure to infer how each variable acts on that outcome, we need to get a sense of which variables are meaningful or not, and we need to quantify the ‘explainability’ of the outcome based on our variables. If our primary aim is to predict the outcome, getting inside the model is less important because we don’t have to explain the outcome, we just need to be confident that it predicts accurately.\nA model constructed to understand an outcome is often called an inferential model. Regression models are the most well-known and well-used inferential models available, providing a wide range of measures and insights that help us explain the relationship between our input variables and our outcome of interest, as we shall see in later chapters of this book.\nThe current reality in the field of people analytics is that inferential models are more required than predictive models. There are two reasons for this. First, data sets in people analytics are rarely large enough to facilitate satisfactory prediction accuracy, and so attention is usually shifted to inference for this reason alone. Second, in the field of people analytics, decisions often have a real impact on individuals. Therefore, even in the rare situations where accurate predictive modeling is attainable, stakeholders are unlikely to trust the output and bear the consequences of predictive models without some sort of elementary understanding of how the predictions are generated. This requires the analyst to consider inference power as well as predictive accuracy in selecting their modeling approach. Again, many regression models come to the fore because they are commonly able to provide both inferential and predictive value.\nFinally, the growing importance of evidence-based practice in many clinical and professional fields has generated a need for more advanced modeling skills to satisfy rising demand for quantitative evidence from decision makers. In people-related fields such as human resources, many varieties of specialized regression-based models such as survival models or latent variable models have crossed from academic and clinical settings into business settings in recent years, and there is an increasing need for qualified individuals who understand and can implement and interpret these models in practice.",

    "section": "1.2 What do we mean by ‘modeling’‍?",
    "text": "1.2 What do we mean by ‘modeling’‍?\nThe term ‘modeling’ has a very wide range of meaning in everyday life and work. In this book we are focused on inferential modeling, and we define that as a specific form of statistical learning, which tries to discover and understand a mathematical relationship between a set of measurements of certain constructs and a measurement of an outcome of interest, based on a sample of data on each. Modeling is both a concept and a process.\n\n1.2.1 The theory of inferential modeling\nWe will start with a theoretical description and then provide a real example from a later chapter to illustrate.\nImagine we have a population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) for which we believe there may be a non-random relationship between a certain construct or set of constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and a certain measurable outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\). Imagine that for a certain sample \\(S\\) of observations from \\(\\mathscr{P}\\), we have a collection of data which we believe measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) to some acceptable level of accuracy, and for which we also have a measure of the outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\).\nBy convention, we denote the set of data that measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) on our sample \\(S\\) as \\(X = x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\), where each \\(x_i\\) is a vector (or column) of data measuring at least one of the constructs in \\(\\mathscr{C}\\). We denote the set of data that measure \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) on our sample set \\(S\\) as \\(y\\). An upper-case \\(X\\) is used because the expectation is that there will be several columns of data measuring our constructs, and a lower-case \\(y\\) is used because the expectation is that the outcome is a single column.\nInferential modeling is the process of learning about a relationship (or lack of relationship) between the data in \\(X\\) and \\(y\\) and using that to describe a relationship (or lack of relationship) between our constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and our outcome \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) that is valid to a high degree of statistical certainty on the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\). This process may include:\n\nTesting a proposed mathematical relationship in the form of a function, structure or iterative method\nComparing that relationship against other proposed relationships\nDescribing the relationship statistically\nDetermining whether the relationship (or certain elements of it) can be generalized from the sample set \\(S\\) to the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\)\n\nWhen we test a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(y\\), we acknowledge that data and measurements are imperfect and so each observation in our sample \\(S\\) may contain random error that we cannot control. Therefore we define our relationship as:\n\\[\ny = f(X) + \\epsilon\n\\] where \\(f\\) is some transformation or function of the data in \\(X\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is a random, uncontrollable error.\n\\(f\\) can take the form of a predetermined function with a formula defined on \\(X\\), like a linear function for example. In this case we can call our model a parametric model. In a parametric model, the modeled value of \\(y\\) is known as soon as we know the values of \\(X\\) by simply applying the formula. In a non-parametric model, there is no predetermined formula that defines the modeled value of \\(y\\) purely in terms of \\(X\\). Non-parametric models need further information in addition to \\(X\\) in order to determine the modeled value of \\(y\\)—for example the value of \\(y\\) in other observations with similar \\(X\\) values.\nRegression models are designed to derive \\(f\\) using estimation based on statistical likelihood and expectation, founded on the theory of the distribution of random variables. Regression models can be both parametric and non-parametric, but by far the most commonly used methods (and the majority of those featured in this book) are parametric. Because of their foundation in statistical likelihood and expectation, they are particularly suited to helping answer questions of generalizability—that is, to what extent can the relationship being observed in the sample \\(S\\) be inferred for the population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\), which is usually the driving force in any form of inferential modeling.\nNote that there is a difference between establishing a statistical relationship between \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) and \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) and establishing a causal relationship between the two. This can be a common trap that inexperienced statistical analysts fall into when communicating the conclusions of their modeling. Establishing that a relationship exists between a construct and an outcome is a far cry from being able to say that one causes the other. This is the common truism that ‘correlation does not equal causation’‍.\nTo bring our theory to life, consider the walkthrough example in Chapter 4 of this book. In this example, we discuss how to establish a relationship between the academic results of students in the first three years of their education program and their results in the fourth year. In this case, our population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) is all past, present and future students who take similar examinations, and our sample \\(S\\) is the students who completed their studies in the past three years. \\(X = x_1, x_2, x_3\\) are each of the three scores from the first three years, and \\(y\\) is the score in the fourth year. We test \\(f\\) to be a linear relationship, and we establish that such a relationship can be generalized to the entire population \\(\\mathscr{P}\\) with a substantial level of statistical confidence1.\nAlmost all our work in this book will refer to the variables \\(X\\) as input variables and the variable \\(y\\) as the outcome variable. There are many other common terms for these which you may find in other sources—for example \\(X\\) are often known as independent variables or covariates while \\(y\\) is often known as a dependent or response variable.\n\n\n1.2.2 The process of inferential modeling\nInferential modeling—regression or otherwise—is a process of numerous steps. Typically the main steps are:\n\nDefining the outcome of interest \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) and the input constructs \\(\\mathscr{C}\\) based on a broader evidence-based objective\nConfirming that \\(\\mathscr{O}\\) has reliable measurement data\nDetermining which data can be used to measure \\(\\mathscr{C}\\)\nDetermining a sample \\(S\\) and collecting, refining and cleaning data.\nPerforming exploratory data analysis (EDA) and proposing a set of models to test for \\(f\\)\nPutting the data in an appropriate format for each model\nRunning the models\nInterpreting the outputs and performing model diagnostics\nSelecting an optimal model or models\nArticulating the inferences that can be generalized to apply to \\(\\mathscr{P}\\)\n\nThis book is primarily focused on steps 7–10 of this process2. That is not to say that steps 1–6 are not important. Indeed these steps are critical and often loaded with analytic traps. Defining the problem, collecting reliable measures and cleaning and organizing data are still the source of much pain and angst for analysts, but these topics are for another day.",

    "text": "1.3 The structure, system and organization of this book\nThe purpose of this book is to put inexperienced practitioners firmly on a path to the confident and appropriate use of regression techniques in their day-to-day work. This requires enough of an understanding of the underlying theory so that judgments can be made about results, but also a practical set of steps to help practitioners apply the most common regression methods to a variety of typical modeling scenarios in a reliable and reproducible way.\nIn most chapters, time is spent on the underlying mathematics. Not to the degree of an academic theorist, but enough to ensure that the reader can associate some mathematical meaning to the outputs of models. While it may be tempting to skip the math, I strongly recommend against it if you intend to be a high performer in your field. The best analysts are those who can genuinely understand what the numbers are telling them.\nThe statistical programming language R is used for most of the practical demonstration in each chapter. Because R is open source and particularly well geared to inferential statistics, it is an excellent choice for those whose work involves a lot of inferential analysis. In later chapters, we show implementations of all of the available methodologies in Python and Julia, which are also powerful open source tools for this sort of work.\nEach chapter involves a walkthrough example to illustrate the specific method and to allow the reader to replicate the analysis for themselves. The exercises at the end of each chapter are designed so that the reader can try the same method on a different data set, or a different problem on the same data set, to test their learning and understanding. All in all, eleven different data sets are used as walkthrough or exercise examples, and all of these data sets are fictitious constructions unless otherwise indicated. Despite the fiction, they are deliberately designed to present the reader with something resembling how the data might look in practice, albeit cleaner and more organized.\nThe chapters of this book are arranged as follows:\n\nChapter 2 covers the basics of the R programming language for those who want to attempt to jump straight in to the work in subsequent chapters but have very little R experience. Experienced R programmers can skip this chapter.\nChapter 3 covers the essential statistical concepts needed to understand multivariable regression models. It also serves as a tutorial in univariate and bivariate statistics illustrated with real data. If you need help developing a decent understanding of descriptive statistics, random distribution and hypothesis testing, this is an important chapter to study.\nChapter 4 covers linear regression and in the course of that introduces many other foundational concepts. The walkthrough example involves modeling academic results from prior results. The exercises involve modeling income levels based on various work and demographic factors.\nChapter 5 covers binomial logistic regression. The walkthrough example involves modeling promotion likelihood based on performance metrics. The exercises involve modeling charitable donation likelihood based on prior donation behavior and demographics.\nChapter 6 covers multinomial regression. The walkthrough example and exercise involves modeling the choice of three health insurance products by company employees based on demographic and position data.\nChapter 7 covers ordinal regression. The walkthrough example involves modeling in-game disciplinary action against soccer players based on prior discipline and other factors. The exercises involve modeling manager performance based on varied data.\nChapter 8 covers modeling options for data with explicit or latent hierarchy. The first part covers mixed modeling and uses a model of speed dating decisions as a walkthrough and example. The second part covers structural equation modeling and uses a survey for a political party as a walkthrough example. The exercises involve modeling latent variables in an employee engagement survey.\nChapter 9 covers survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard regression and frailty models. The chapter uses employee attrition as a walkthrough example and exercise.\nChapter 10 outlines alternative technical approaches to regression modeling in R, Python and Julia. Models from previous chapters are used to illustrate these alternative approaches.\nChapter 11 covers power analysis, focusing in particular on estimating the required minimum sample sizes in establishing meaningful inferences for both simple statistical tests and multivariate models. Examples related to experimental studies are used to illustrate, such as concurrent validity studies of selection instruments. Example implementations in R, Python and Julia are outlined.",

    "text": "2.1 What is R?\nMost of the work in this book is implemented in the R statistical programming language which, along with Python, is one of the two languages that I use in my day-to-day statistical analysis. Sample implementations in Python are also provided at the end of the relevant chapters or sections. I have made efforts to keep the code as simple as possible, and I have tried to avoid the use of too many external packages. For the most part, readers should see (especially in the earlier chapters) that code blocks are short and simple, relying wherever possible on base R functionality. No doubt there are neater and more effective ways to code some of the material in this book using a wide array of R packages, but my priority has been to keep the code simple, consistent and easily reproducible.\nFor those who wish to follow the method and theory without the implementations in this book, there is no need to read this chapter. However, the style of this book is to use implementation to illustrate theory and practice, and so tolerance of many code blocks will be necessary as you read onward.\nFor those who wish to simply replicate the models as quickly as possible, they will be able to avail of the code block copying feature, which appears whenever you scroll over an input code block. Assuming all the required external packages have been installed, these code blocks should all be transportable and immediately usable. For those who are extra-inquisitive and want to explore how I constructed graphics used for illustration (for which code is usually not displayed), the best place to go is the Github repository for this book.\nThis chapter is for those who wish to learn the methods in this book but do not know how to use R. However, it is not intended to be a full tutorial on R. There are many more qualified individuals and existing resources that would better serve that purpose—in particular I recommend Wickham and Grolemund (2016). It is recommended that you consult these resources and become comfortable with the basics of R before proceeding into the later chapters of this book. However, acknowledging that many will want to dive in sooner rather than later, this chapter covers the absolute basics of R that will allow the uninitiated reader to proceed with at least some orientation.\nR is a programming language that was originally developed by and for statisticians, but in recent years its capabilities and the environments in which it is used have expanded greatly, with extensive use nowadays in academia and the public and private sectors. There are many advantages to using a programming language like R. Here are some:\nThere is often heated debate about which tools are better for doing non-trivial statistical analysis. I personally find that R provides the widest array of resources for those interested in inferential modeling, while Python has a more well-developed toolkit for predictive modeling and machine learning. Since the primary focus of this book is inferential modeling, the in-depth walkthroughs are coded in R.",

    "text": "2.2 How to start using R\nJust like most programming languages, R itself is an interpreter which receives input and returns output. It is not very easy to use without an IDE. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which is a convenient user interface allowing an R programmer to do all their main tasks including writing and running R code, saving files, viewing data and plots, integrating code into documents and many other things. By far the most popular IDE for R is RStudio. An example of what the RStudio IDE looks like can be seen in Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The RStudio IDE\n\n\n\nTo start using R, follow these steps:\n\nDownload and install the latest version of R from https://www.r-project.org/. Ensure that the version suits your operating system.\nDownload the latest version of the RStudio Desktop IDE from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Consult the user guide at https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ to help orient yourself to the features of RStudio.\n\nOpen RStudio and play around.\n\nThe initial stages of using R can be challenging, mostly due to the need to become familiar with how R understands, stores and processes data. Extensive trial and error is a learning necessity. Perseverance is important in these early stages, as well as an openness to seek help from others either in person or via online forums. Try not to rely too much on Generative AI tools for help, as they can often lead to you missing important learning steps, and they can also generate error-prone code.",

    "text": "2.3 Data in R\nAs you start to do tasks involving data in R, you will generally want to store the things you create so that you can refer to them later. Simply calculating something does not store it in R. For example, a simple calculation like this can be performed easily:\n\n3 + 3\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nHowever, as soon as the calculation is complete, it is forgotten by R because the result hasn’t been assigned anywhere. To store something in your R session, you will assign it a name using the &lt;- operator. So I can assign my previous calculation to an object called my_sum, and this allows me to access the value at any time.\n\n# store the result\nmy_sum &lt;- 3 + 3\n\n# now I can work with it\nmy_sum + 3\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nYou will see above that you can comment your code by simply adding a # to the start of a line to ensure that the line is ignored by the interpreter.\nNote that assignment to an object does not result in the value being displayed. To display the value, the name of the object must be typed, the print() command used or the command should be wrapped in parentheses.\n\n# show me the value of my_sum\nmy_sum\n\n[1] 6\n\n# assign my_sum + 3 to new_sum and show its value\n(new_sum &lt;- my_sum + 3)\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Data types\nAll data in R has an associated type, to reflect the wide range of data that R is able to work with. The typeof() function can be used to see the type of a single scalar value. Let’s look at the most common scalar data types.\nNumeric data can be in integer form or double (decimal) form.\n\n# integers can be signified by adding an 'L' to the end\nmy_integer &lt;- 1L  \nmy_double &lt;- 6.38\n\ntypeof(my_integer)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\ntypeof(my_double)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nCharacter data is text data surrounded by single or double quotes.\n\nmy_character &lt;- \"THIS IS TEXT\"\ntypeof(my_character)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nLogical data takes the form TRUE or FALSE.\n\nmy_logical &lt;- TRUE\ntypeof(my_logical)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Homogeneous data structures\nVectors are one-dimensional structures containing data of the same type and are notated by using c(). The type of the vector can also be viewed using the typeof() function, but the str() function can be used to display both the contents of the vector and its type.\n\nmy_double_vector &lt;- c(2.3, 6.8, 4.5, 65, 6)\nstr(my_double_vector)\n\n num [1:5] 2.3 6.8 4.5 65 6\n\n\nCategorical data—which takes only a finite number of possible values—can be stored as a factor vector to make it easier to perform grouping and manipulation.\n\ncategories &lt;- factor(\n  c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"A\", \"C\")\n)\n\nstr(categories)\n\n Factor w/ 3 levels \"A\",\"B\",\"C\": 1 2 3 1 3\n\n\nIf needed, the factors can be given order.\n\n# character vector \nranking &lt;- c(\"Medium\", \"High\", \"Low\")\nstr(ranking)\n\n chr [1:3] \"Medium\" \"High\" \"Low\"\n\n# turn it into an ordered factor\nranking_factors &lt;- ordered(\n  ranking, levels = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")\n)\n\nstr(ranking_factors)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"Low\"&lt;\"Medium\"&lt;..: 2 3 1\n\n\nThe number of elements in a vector can be seen using the length() function.\n\nlength(categories)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nSimple numeric sequence vectors can be created using shorthand notation.\n\n(my_sequence &lt;- 1:10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIf you try to mix data types inside a vector, it will usually result in type coercion, where one or more of the types are forced into a different type to ensure homogeneity. Often this means the vector will become a character vector.\n\n# numeric sequence vector\nvec &lt;- 1:5\nstr(vec)\n\n int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n# create a new vector containing vec and the character \"hello\"\nnew_vec &lt;- c(vec, \"hello\")\n\n# numeric values have been coerced into their character equivalents\nstr(new_vec)\n\n chr [1:6] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"hello\"\n\n\nBut sometimes logical or factor types will be coerced to numeric.\n\n# attempt a mixed logical and numeric\nmix &lt;- c(TRUE, 6)\n\n# logical has been converted to binary numeric (TRUE = 1)\nstr(mix)\n\n num [1:2] 1 6\n\n# try to add a numeric to our previous categories factor vector\nnew_categories &lt;- c(categories, 1)\n\n# categories have been coerced to background integer representations\nstr(new_categories)\n\n num [1:6] 1 2 3 1 3 1\n\n\nMatrices are two-dimensional data structures of the same type and are built from a vector by defining the number of rows and columns. Data is read into the matrix down the columns, starting left and moving right. Matrices are rarely used for non-numeric data types.\n\n# create a 2x2 matrix with the first four integers\n(m &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nArrays are n-dimensional data structures with the same data type and are not used extensively by most R users.\n\n\n2.3.3 Heterogeneous data structures\nLists are one-dimensional data structures that can take data of any type.\n\nmy_list &lt;- list(6, TRUE, \"hello\")\nstr(my_list)\n\nList of 3\n $ : num 6\n $ : logi TRUE\n $ : chr \"hello\"\n\n\nList elements can be any data type and any dimension. Each element can be given a name.\n\nnew_list &lt;- list(\n  scalar = 6, \n  vector = c(\"Hello\", \"Goodbye\"), \n  matrix = matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n)\n\nstr(new_list)\n\nList of 3\n $ scalar: num 6\n $ vector: chr [1:2] \"Hello\" \"Goodbye\"\n $ matrix: int [1:2, 1:2] 1 2 3 4\n\n\nNamed list elements can be accessed by using $.\n\nnew_list$matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nDataframes are the most used data structure in R; they are effectively a named list of vectors of the same length, with each vector as a column. As such, a dataframe is very similar in nature to a typical database table or spreadsheet.\n\n# two vectors of different types but same length\nnames &lt;- c(\"John\", \"Ayesha\")\nages &lt;- c(31, 24)\n\n# create a dataframe\n(df &lt;- data.frame(names, ages))\n\n   names ages\n1   John   31\n2 Ayesha   24\n\n# get types of columns\nstr(df)\n\n'data.frame':   2 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ names: chr  \"John\" \"Ayesha\"\n $ ages : num  31 24\n\n# get dimensions of df\ndim(df)\n\n[1] 2 2",

    "text": "2.4 Working with dataframes\nThe dataframe is the most common data structure used by analysts in R, due to its similarity to data tables found in databases and spreadsheets. We will work almost entirely with dataframes in this book, so let’s get to know them.\n\n2.4.1 Loading and tidying data in dataframes\nTo work with data in R, you usually need to pull it in from an outside source into a dataframe1. R facilitates numerous ways of importing data from simple .csv files, from Excel files, from online sources or from databases. Let’s load a data set that we will use later—the salespeople data set, which contains some information on the sales, average customer ratings and performance ratings of salespeople. The read.csv() function can accept a URL address of the file if it is online.\n\n# url of data set \nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv\"\n\n# load the data set and store it as a dataframe called salespeople\nsalespeople &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\nWe might not want to display this entire data set before knowing how big it is. We can view the dimensions, and if it is too big to display, we can use the head() function to display just the first few rows.\n\ndim(salespeople)\n\n[1] 351   4\n\n# hundreds of rows, so view first few\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nWe can view a specific column by using $, and we can use square brackets to view a specific entry. For example if we wanted to see the 6th entry of the sales column:\n\nsalespeople$sales[6]\n\n[1] 918\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use a [row, column] index to get a specific entry in the dataframe.\n\nsalespeople[34, 4]\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can take a look at the data types using str().\n\nstr(salespeople)\n\n'data.frame':   351 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ promoted     : int  0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ sales        : int  594 446 674 525 657 918 318 364 342 387 ...\n $ customer_rate: num  3.94 4.06 3.83 3.62 4.4 4.54 3.09 4.89 3.74 3 ...\n $ performance  : int  2 3 4 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 ...\n\n\nWe can also see a statistical summary of each column using summary(), which tells us various statistics depending on the type of the column.\n\nsummary(salespeople)\n\n    promoted          sales       customer_rate    performance \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :151.0   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:389.2   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :0.0000   Median :475.0   Median :3.620   Median :3.0  \n Mean   :0.3219   Mean   :527.0   Mean   :3.608   Mean   :2.5  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:667.2   3rd Qu.:4.290   3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :945.0   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :4.0  \n                  NA's   :1       NA's   :1       NA's   :1    \n\n\nNote that there is missing data in this dataframe, indicated by NAs in the summary. Missing data is identified by a special NA value in R. This should not be confused with \"NA\", which is simply a character string. The function is.na() will look at all values in a vector or dataframe and return TRUE or FALSE based on whether they are NA or not. By adding these up using the sum() function, it will take TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, which effectively provides a count of missing data.\n\nsum(is.na(salespeople))\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThis is a small number of NAs given the dimensions of our data set and we might want to remove the rows of data that contain NAs. The easiest way is to use the complete.cases() function, which identifies the rows that have no NAs, and then we can select those rows from the dataframe based on that condition. Note that you can overwrite objects with the same name in R.\n\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# confirm no NAs\nsum(is.na(salespeople))\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nWe can see the unique values of a vector or column using the unique() function.\n\nunique(salespeople$performance)\n\n[1] 2 3 4 1\n\n\nIf we need to change the type of a column in a dataframe, we can use the as.numeric(), as.character(), as.logical() or as.factor() functions. For example, given that there are only four unique values for the performance column, we may want to convert it to a factor.\n\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$performance)\nstr(salespeople)\n\n'data.frame':   350 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ promoted     : int  0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ sales        : int  594 446 674 525 657 918 318 364 342 387 ...\n $ customer_rate: num  3.94 4.06 3.83 3.62 4.4 4.54 3.09 4.89 3.74 3 ...\n $ performance  : Factor w/ 4 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\": 2 3 4 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 ...\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Manipulating dataframes\nDataframes can be subsetted to contain only rows that satisfy specific conditions.\n\n(sales_720 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales == 720))\n\n    promoted sales customer_rate performance\n290        1   720          3.76           3\n\n\nNote the use of ==, which is used in many programming languages, to test for precise equality. Similarly we can select columns based on inequalities (&gt; for ‘greater than’‍, &lt; for ‘less than’‍, &gt;= for ‘greater than or equal to’‍, &lt;= for ‘less than or equal to’‍, or != for ‘not equal to’). For example:\n\nhigh_sales &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales &gt;= 700)\nhead(high_sales)\n\n   promoted sales customer_rate performance\n6         1   918          4.54           2\n12        1   716          3.16           3\n20        1   937          5.00           2\n21        1   702          3.53           4\n25        1   819          4.45           2\n26        1   736          3.94           4\n\n\nTo select specific columns use the select argument.\n\nsalespeople_sales_perf &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                                 select = c(\"sales\", \"performance\"))\nhead(salespeople_sales_perf)\n\n  sales performance\n1   594           2\n2   446           3\n3   674           4\n4   525           2\n5   657           3\n6   918           2\n\n\nTwo dataframes with the same column names can be combined by their rows.\n\nlow_sales &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = sales &lt; 400)\n\n# bind the rows of low_sales and high_sales together\nlow_and_high_sales = rbind(low_sales, high_sales)\nhead(low_and_high_sales)\n\n   promoted sales customer_rate performance\n7         0   318          3.09           3\n8         0   364          4.89           1\n9         0   342          3.74           3\n10        0   387          3.00           3\n15        0   344          3.02           2\n16        0   372          3.87           3\n\n\nTwo dataframes with different column names can be combined by their columns.\n\n# two dataframes with two columns each\nsales_perf &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                     select = c(\"sales\", \"performance\"))\nprom_custrate &lt;- subset(salespeople, \n                        select = c(\"promoted\", \"customer_rate\"))\n\n# bind the columns to create a dataframe with four columns\nfull_df &lt;- cbind(sales_perf, prom_custrate)\nhead(full_df)\n\n  sales performance promoted customer_rate\n1   594           2        0          3.94\n2   446           3        0          4.06\n3   674           4        1          3.83\n4   525           2        0          3.62\n5   657           3        1          4.40\n6   918           2        1          4.54",

    "section": "2.5 Functions, packages and libraries",
    "text": "2.5 Functions, packages and libraries\nIn the code so far we have used a variety of functions. For example head(), subset(), rbind(). Functions are operations that take certain defined inputs and return an output. Functions exist to perform common useful operations.\n\n2.5.1 Using functions\nFunctions usually take one or more arguments. Often there are a large number of arguments that a function can take, but many are optional and not required to be specified by the user. For example, the function head(), which displays the first rows of a dataframe2, has only one required argument x: the name of the dataframe. A second argument is optional, n: the number of rows to display. If n is not entered, it is assumed to have the default value n = 6.\nWhen running a function, you can either specify the arguments by name or you can enter them in order without their names. If you enter arguments without naming them, R expects the arguments to be entered in exactly the right order.\n\n# see the head of salespeople, with the default of six rows\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\n\n# see fewer rows - arguments need to be in the right order if not named\nhead(salespeople, 3)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n\n\n\n# or if you don't know the right order, \n# name your arguments and you can put them in any order\nhead(n = 3, x = salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Help with functions\nMost functions in R have excellent help documentation. To get help on the head() function, type help(head) or ?head. This will display the results in the Help browser window in RStudio. Alternatively you can open the Help browser window directly in RStudio and do a search there. An example of the browser results for head() is in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Results of a search for the head() function in the RStudio Help browser\n\n\n\nThe help page normally shows the following:\n\nDescription of the purpose of the function\nUsage examples, so you can quickly see how it is used\nArguments list so you can see the names and order of arguments\nDetails or notes on further considerations on use\nExpected value of the output (for example head() is expected to return a similar object to its first input x)\nExamples to help orient you further (sometimes examples can be very abstract in nature and not so helpful to users)\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Writing your own functions\nFunctions are not limited to those that come packaged in R. Users can write their own functions to perform tasks that are helpful to their objectives. Experienced programmers in most languages subscribe to a principle called DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Whenever a task needs to be done repeatedly, it is poor practice to write the same code numerous times. It makes more sense to write a function to do the task.\nIn this example, a simple function is written which generates a report on a dataframe:\n\n# create df_report function\ndf_report &lt;- function(df) {\n  paste(\"This dataframe contains\", nrow(df), \"rows and\", \n        ncol(df), \"columns. There are\", sum(is.na(df)), \"NA entries.\")\n}\n\nWe can test our function by using the built-in mtcars data set in R.\n\ndf_report(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"This dataframe contains 32 rows and 11 columns. There are 0 NA entries.\"\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Installing packages\nAll the common functions that we have used so far exist in the base R installation. However, the beauty of open source languages like R is that users can write their own functions or resources and release them to others via packages. A package is an additional module that can be installed easily; it makes resources available which are not in the base R installation. In this book we will be using functions from both base R and from popular and useful packages. As an example, a popular package used for statistical modeling is the MASS package, which is based on methods in a popular applied statistics book3.\nBefore an external package can be used, it must be installed into your package library using install.packages(). So to install MASS, type install.packages(\"MASS\") into the console. This will send R to the main internet repository for R packages (known as CRAN). It will find the right version of MASS for your operating system and download and install it into your package library. If MASS needs other packages in order to work, it will also install these packages.\nIf you want to install more than one package, put the names of the packages inside a character vector—for example:\n\nmy_packages &lt;- c(\"MASS\", \"DescTools\", \"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(my_packages)\n\nOnce you have installed a package, you can see what functions are available by calling for help on it, for example using help(package = MASS). One package you may wish to install now is the peopleanalyticsdata package, which contains all the data sets used in this book. By installing and loading this package, all the data sets used in this book will be loaded into your R session and ready to work with. If you do this, you can ignore the read.csv() commands later in the book, which download the data from the internet.\n\n\n2.5.5 Using packages\nOnce you have installed a package into your package library, to use it in your R session you need to load it using the library() function. For example, to load MASS after installing it, use library(MASS). Often nothing will happen when you use this command, but rest assured the package has been loaded and you can start to use the functions inside it. Sometimes when you load the package a series of messages will display, usually to make you aware of certain things that you need to keep in mind when using the package. Note that whenever you see the library() command in this book, it is assumed that you have already installed the package in that command. If you have not, the library() command will fail.\nOnce a package is loaded from your library, you can use any of the functions inside it. For example, the stepAIC() function is not available before you load the MASS package but becomes available after it is loaded. In this sense, functions ‘belong’ to packages.\nProblems can occur when you load packages that contain functions with the same name as functions that already exist in your R session. Often the messages you see when loading a package will alert you to this. When R is faced with a situation where a function exists in multiple packages you have loaded, R always defaults to the function in the most recently loaded package. This may not always be what you intended.\nOne way to completely avoid this issue is to get in the habit of namespacing your functions. To namespace, you simply use package::function(), so to safely call stepAIC() from MASS, you use MASS::stepAIC(). Most of the time in this book when a function is being called from a package outside base R, I use namespacing to call that function. This should help avoid confusion about which packages are being used for which functions.\n\n\n2.5.6 The pipe operator\nEven in the most elementary briefing about R, it is very difficult to ignore the pipe operator. The pipe operator makes code more natural to read and write and reduces the typical computing problem of many nested operations inside parentheses.\nAs an example, imagine we wanted to do the following two operations in one command:\n\nSubset salespeople to only the sales values of those with sales less than 500\nTake the mean of those values\n\nIn base R, one way to do this is:\n\nmean(subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500))\n\n[1] 388.6684\n\n\nThis is nested and needs to be read from the inside out in order to align with the instructions. The pipe operator |&gt; takes the command that comes before it and places it inside the function that follows it (by default as the first argument). This reduces complexity and allows you to follow the logic more clearly.\n\n# use the pipe operator to lay out the steps more logically\nsubset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500) |&gt; \n  mean() \n\n[1] 388.6684\n\n\nThis can be extended to perform arbitrarily many operations in one piped command.\n\nsalespeople$sales |&gt; # start with all data\n  subset(subset = salespeople$sales &lt; 500) |&gt; # get the subsetted data\n  mean() |&gt; # take the mean value\n  round() # round to the nearest integer\n\n[1] 389\n\n\nThe pipe operator is unique to R and is very widely used because it helps to make code more readable, it reduces complexity, and it helps orient around a common ‘grammar’ for the manipulation of data. The pipe operator helps you structure your code more clearly around nouns (objects), verbs (functions) and adverbs (arguments of functions). One of the most developed sets of packages in R that follows these principles is the tidyverse family of packages, which I encourage you to explore.",

    "text": "2.6 Errors, warnings and messages\nAs I mentioned earlier in this chapter, getting familiar with R can be frustrating at the beginning if you have never programmed before. You can expect to regularly see messages, warnings or errors in response to your commands. I encourage you to regard these as your friend rather than your enemy. It is very tempting to take the latter approach when you are starting out, but over time I hope you will appreciate some wisdom from my words.\nErrors are serious problems which usually result in the halting of your code and a failure to return your requested output. They usually come with an indication of the source of the error, and these can sometimes be easy to understand and sometimes frustratingly vague and abstract. For example, an easy-to-understand error is:\n\nsubset(salespeople, subset = sales = 720)\n\nError: unexpected '=' in \"subset(salespeople, subset = sales =\"\nThis helps you see that you have used sales = 720 as a condition to subset your data, when you should have used sales == 720 for precise equality.\nA much more challenging error to understand is:\n\nhead[salespeople]\n\nError in head[salespeople] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable\nWhen first faced with an error that you can’t understand, try not to get frustrated and proceed in the knowledge that it usually can be fixed easily and quickly. Often the problem is much more obvious than you think, and if not, there is still a 99% likelihood that others have made this error and you can read about it online. The first step is to take a look at your code to see if you can spot what you did wrong. In this case, you may see that you have used square brackets [] instead of parentheses () when calling your head() function. If you cannot see what is wrong, the next steps are to ask a colleague, do an internet search with the text of the error message you receive, ask a Generative AI coding assistant or consult online forums like https://stackoverflow.com. The more experienced you become, the easier it is to interpret error messages.\nWarnings are less serious and usually alert you to something that you might be overlooking and which could indicate a problem with the output. In many cases you can ignore warnings, but sometimes they are an important reminder to go back and edit your code. For example, you may run a model which doesn’t converge, and while this does not stop R from returning results, it is also very useful for you to know that it didn’t converge.\nMessages are pieces of information that may or may not be useful to you at a particular point in time. Sometimes you will receive messages when you load a package from your library. Sometimes messages will keep you up to date on the progress of a process that is taking a long time to execute.",

    "section": "2.7 Plotting and graphing",
    "text": "2.7 Plotting and graphing\nAs you might expect in a well-developed programming language, there are numerous ways to plot and graph information in R. If you are doing exploratory data analysis on fairly simple data and you don’t need to worry about pretty appearance or formatting, the built-in plot capabilities of base R are fine. If you need a pretty appearance, more precision, color coding or even 3D graphics or animation, there are also specialized plotting and graphing packages for these purposes. In general when working interactively in RStudio, graphical output will be rendered in the Plots pane, where you can copy it or save it as an image.\n\n2.7.1 Plotting in base R\nThe simplest plot function in base R is plot(). This performs basic X-Y plotting. As an example, this code will generate a scatter plot of customer_rate against sales in the salespeople data set, with the results displayed in Figure 2.3. Note the use of the arguments main, xlab and ylab for customizing the axis labels and title for the plot.\n\n\n\n\n# scatter plot of customer_rate against sales\nplot(x = salespeople$sales, y = salespeople$customer_rate,\n     xlab = \"Sales ($m)\", ylab = \"Average customer rating\",\n     main = \"Scatterplot of Sales vs Customer Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Simple scatterplot of customer_rate against sales in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nHistograms of data can be generated using the hist() function. This command will generate a histogram of performance as displayed in Figure 2.4. Note the use of breaks to customize how the bars appear.\n\n\n\n\n# convert performance ratings back to numeric data type for histogram\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.numeric(salespeople$performance)\n\n# histogram of performance ratings\nhist(salespeople$performance, breaks = 0:4,\n     xlab = \"Performance Rating\", \n     main = \"Histogram of Performance Ratings\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Simple histogram of performance in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nBox and whisker plots are excellent ways to see the distribution of a variable, and can be grouped against another variable to see bivariate patterns. For example, this command will show a box and whisker plot of sales grouped against performance, with the output shown in Figure 2.5. Note the use of the formula and data notation here to define the variable we are interested in and how we want it grouped. We will study this formula notation in greater depth later in this book.\n\n\n\n\n# box plot of sales by performance rating\nboxplot(formula = sales ~ performance, data = salespeople,\n        xlab = \"Performance Rating\", ylab = \"Sales ($m)\",\n        main = \"Boxplot of Sales by Performance Rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Simple box plot of sales grouped against performance in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nThese are among the most common plots used for data exploration purposes. They are examples of a wider range of plotting and graphing functions available in base R, such as line plots, bar plots and other varieties which you may see later in this book.\n\n\n2.7.2 Specialist plotting and graphing packages\nBy far the most commonly used specialist plotting and graphing package in R is ggplot2. ggplot2 allows the flexible construction of a very wide range of charts and graphs, but uses a very specific command grammar which can take some getting used to. However, once learned, ggplot2 can be an extremely powerful tool. Many of the illustratory figures used in this book are developed using ggplot2 and while the code for these figures is generally not included for the sake of brevity, you can always find it in the source code of this book on Github4. A great learning resource for ggplot2 is Wickham (2016).\nThe plotly package allows the use of the plotly graphing library in R. This is an excellent package for interactive graphing and is used for 3D illustrations in this book. Output can be rendered in HTML—allowing the user to play with and explore the graphs interactively—or can be saved as static 2D images.\nGGally is a package that extends ggplot2 to allow easy combination of charts and graphs. This is particularly valuable for quicker exploratory data analysis. One of its most popular functions is ggpairs(), which produces a pairplot. A pairplot is a visualization of all univariate and bivariate patterns in a data set, with univariate distributions in the diagonal and bivariate relationships or correlations displayed in the off-diagonal. Figure 2.6 is an example of a pairplot for the salespeople data set, which we will explore further in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# convert performance and promotion to categorical\nsalespeople$promoted &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$promoted)\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$performance)\n\n# pairplot of salespeople\nGGally::ggpairs(salespeople)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Pairplot of the salespeople data set",

    "text": "2.8 Documenting your work using Quarto\nFor anyone performing any sort of multivariable analysis using a statistical programming language, appropriate documentation and reproducibility of the work is essential to its success and longevity. If your code is not easily obtained or run by others, it is likely to have a very limited impact and lifetime. Learning how to create integrated documents that contain both text and code is critical to providing access to your code and narration of your work.\nQuarto is a package which allows you to create integrated documents containing both formatted text and executed code. It is, in my opinion, one of the best resources available currently for this purpose. This entire book has been created using Quarto. You can start a Quarto document in RStudio by installing the by opening a new Quarto document file, which will have the suffix .qmd.\nQuarto documents always start with a particular heading type called a YAML header, which contains overall information on the document you are creating. Care must be taken with the precise formatting of the YAML header, as it is sensitive to spacing and indentation. Usually a basic YAML header is created for you in RStudio when you start a new .qmd file. Here is an example.\n---\ntitle: \"My new document\"\nauthor: \"Keith McNulty\"\ndate: 2025-11-10\nformat: html\n---\nThe format part of this header has numerous options, but the most commonly used are html, which generates your document as a web page, and pdf, which generates your document as a PDF using the open source LaTeX software package. If you wish to create PDF documents you will need to have a version of LaTeX installed on your system. Running the system command quarto install tinytex will install a minimal version of LaTeX which is fine for most purposes.\nQuarto allows you to build a formatted document using many shorthand formatting commands. Here are a few examples of how to format headings and place web links or images in your document:\n# My top heading\n\nThis section is about this general topic.\n\n## My first sub heading \n\nTo see more information on this sub-topic visit [here](https://my.web.link).\n\n## My second sub heading\n\nHere is a nice picture about this sub-topic.\n\n![](path/to/image)\nCode can be written and executed and the results displayed inline using backticks. For example, writing\n`r nrow(salespeople)`\ninline will display 351 in the final document. Entire code blocks can be included and executed by using triple-backticks. The following code block:\n```{r}\n# show the first few rows of salespeople\nhead(salespeople)\n```\nwill display this output:\n\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nThe {} wrapping allows you to specify different languages for your code chunk. For example, if you wanted to run Python code instead of R code you can use {python}.\nYou can set options for your code chunks inside a code block by starting your line with #|. For example, if you want the results of your code to be displayed, but without the code itself being displayed, you can start your code block with the line #| echo: false.\nThe process of compiling your Quarto code to produce a document is known as ‘rendering’. To create a rendered document, you simply need to click on the ‘Render’ button in RStudio that appears above your Quarto code.\nIf you are not familiar with Quarto, I strongly encourage you to learn it alongside R and to challenge yourself to write up any practice exercises you take on in this book using Quarto.

    "text": "3.1 Elementary descriptive statistics of populations and samples\nTo properly understand multivariable models, an analyst needs to have a decent grasp of foundational statistics. Many of the assumptions and results of multivariable models require an understanding of these foundations in order to be properly interpreted. There are three topics that are particularly important for those proceeding further in this book:\nIf you have never really studied these topics, I would strongly recommend taking a course in them and spending good time getting to know them. Again, just as the last chapter was not intended to be a comprehensive tutorial on R, neither is this chapter intended to be a comprehensive tutorial on introductory statistics. However, we will introduce some key concepts here that are critical to understanding later chapters, and as always we will illustrate using real data examples.\nIn preparation for this chapter we are going to download a data set that we will work through in a later chapter, and use it for practical examples and illustration purposes. The data are a set of information on the sales, customer ratings and performance ratings on a set of 351 salespeople as well as an indication of whether or not they were promoted.\nLet’s take a brief look at the first few rows of this data to make sure we know what is inside it.\nAnd let’s understand the structure of this data.\nIt looks like:\nAny collection of numerical data on one or more variables can be described using a number of common statistical concepts.

    "text": "3.1.1 Mean, variance and standard deviation\nThe mean is the average value of the observations and is defined by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) of our sample \\(x\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i\n\\] While the mean of a sample \\(x\\) is denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\), the mean of an entire population is usually denoted by \\(\\mu\\). The mean can have a different interpretation depending on the type of data being studied. Let’s look at the mean of three different columns of our salespeople data, making sure to ignore any missing data.\n\nmean(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 527.0057\n\n\nThis looks very intuitive and appears to be the average amount of sales made by the individuals in the data set.\n\nmean(salespeople$promoted, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.3219373\n\n\nGiven that this data can only have the value of 0 or 1, we interpret this mean as the likelihood or expectation that an individual will be labeled as 1. That is, the average probability of promotion in the data set. If this data showed a perfectly random likelihood of promotion, we would expect this to take the value of 0.5. But it is lower than 0.5, which tells us that the majority of individuals are not promoted.\n\nmean(salespeople$performance, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nGiven that this data can only have the values 1, 2, 3 or 4, we interpret this as the expected value of the performance rating in the data set. Higher or lower means inform us about the distribution of the performance ratings. A low mean will indicate a skew towards a low rating, and a high mean will indicate a skew towards a high rating.\nOther common statistical summary measures include the median, which is the middle value when the values are ranked in order, and the mode, which is the most frequently occurring value.\nThe variance is a measure of how much the data varies around its mean. There are two different definitions of variance. The population variance assumes that that we are working with the entire population and is defined as the average squared difference from the mean:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_p(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\] The sample variance assumes that we are working with a sample and attempts to estimate the variance of a larger population by applying Bessel’s correction to account for potential sampling error. The sample variance is:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_s(x) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\]\nYou can see that\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Var}_p(x) = \\frac{n - 1}{n}\\mathrm{Var}_s(x)\n\\] So as the data set gets larger, the sample variance and the population variance become less and less distinguishable, which intuitively makes sense.\nBecause we rarely work with full populations, the sample variance is calculated by default in R and in many other statistical software packages.\n\n# sample variance \n(sample_variance_sales &lt;- var(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n[1] 34308.11\n\n\nSo where necessary, we need to apply a transformation to get the population variance.\n\n# population variance (need length of non-NA data)\nn &lt;- length(na.omit(salespeople$sales))\n(population_variance_sales &lt;- ((n-1)/n) * sample_variance_sales)\n\n[1] 34210.09\n\n\nVariance does not have intuitive scale relative to the data being studied, because we have used a ‘squared distance metric’‍, therefore we can square-root it to get a measure of ‘deviance’ on the same scale as the data. We call this the standard deviation \\(\\sigma(x)\\), where \\(\\mathrm{Var}(x) = \\sigma(x)^2\\). As with variance, standard deviation has both population and sample versions, and the sample version is calculated by default. Conversion between the two takes the form\n\\[\n\\sigma_p(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{n-1}{n}}\\sigma_s(x)\n\\]\n\n# sample standard deviation\n(sample_sd_sales &lt;- sd(salespeople$sales, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n[1] 185.2245\n\n# verify that sample sd is sqrt(sample var)\nsample_sd_sales == sqrt(sample_variance_sales)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# calculate population standard deviation\n(population_sd_sales &lt;- sqrt((n-1)/n) * sample_sd_sales)\n\n[1] 184.9597\n\n\nGiven the range of sales is [151, 945] and the mean is 527, we see that the standard deviation gives a more intuitive sense of the ‘spread’ of the data relative to its inherent scale.\n\n\n3.1.2 Covariance and correlation\nThe covariance between two variables is a measure of the extent to which one changes as the other changes. If \\(y = y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\) is a second variable, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\) are the means of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, then the sample covariance of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is defined as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{cov}_s(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\n\\] and as with variance, the population covariance is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{cov}_p(x, y) = \\frac{n-1}{n}\\mathrm{cov}_s(x, y)\n\\]\nAgain, the sample covariance is the default in R, and we need to transform to obtain the population covariance.\n\n# get sample covariance for sales and customer_rate, \n# ignoring observations with missing data\n(sample_cov &lt;- cov(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate, \n                   use = \"complete.obs\"))\n\n[1] 55.81769\n\n# convert to population covariance (need number of complete obs)\ncols &lt;- subset(salespeople, select = c(\"sales\", \"customer_rate\"))\nn &lt;- nrow(cols[complete.cases(cols), ])\n(population_cov &lt;- ((n-1)/n) * sample_cov)\n\n[1] 55.65821\n\n\nAs can be seen, the difference in covariance is very small between the sample and population versions, and both confirm a positive relationship between sales and customer rating. However, we again see this issue that there is no intuitive sense of scale for this measure.\nPearson’s correlation coefficient divides the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables:\n\\[\nr_{x, y} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x, y)}{\\sigma(x)\\sigma(y)}\n\\] This creates a scale of \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) for \\(r_{x, y}\\), which is an intuitive way of understanding both the direction and strength of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with \\(-1\\) indicating that \\(x\\) increases perfectly as \\(y\\) decreases, \\(1\\) indicating that \\(x\\) increases perfectly as \\(y\\) increases, and \\(0\\) indicating that there is no relationship between the two.\nAs before, there is a sample and population version of the correlation coefficient, and R calculates the sample version by default. Similar transformations can be used to determine a population correlation coefficient and over large samples the two measures converge.\n\n# calculate sample correlation between sales and customer_rate\ncor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate, use = \"complete.obs\")\n\n[1] 0.337805\n\n\nThis tells us that there is a moderate positive correlation between sales and customer rating.\nYou will notice that we have so far used two variables on a continuous scale to demonstrate covariance and correlation.

    "section": "3.2 Distribution of random variables",
    "text": "3.2 Distribution of random variables\nAs we outlined in Section 1.2, when we build a model we are using a set of sample data to infer a general relationship on a larger population. A major underlying assumption in our inference is that we believe the real-life variables we are dealing with are random in nature. For example, we might be trying to model the drivers of the voting choice of millions of people in a national election, but we may only have sample data on a few thousand people. When we infer nationwide voting intentions from our sample, we assume that the characteristics of the voting population are random variables.\n\n3.2.1 Sampling of random variables\nWhen we describe variables as random, we are assuming that they take a form which is independent and identically distributed. Using our salespeople data as an example, we are assuming that the sales of one person in the data set is not influenced by the sales of another person in the data set. In this case, this seems like a reasonable assumption, and we will be making it for many (though not all) of the statistical methods used in this book. However, it is good to recognize that there are scenarios where this assumption cannot be made. For example, if the salespeople worked together in serving the same customers on the same products, and each individual’s sales represented some proportion of the overall sales to the customer, we cannot say that the sales data is independent and identically distributed. In this case, we will expect to see some hierarchy in our data and will need to adjust our techniques accordingly to take this into consideration.\nUnder the central limit theorem, if we take samples from a random variable and calculate a summary statistic for each sample, that statistic is itself a random variable, and its mean converges to the true population statistic with more and more sampling. Let’s test this with a little experiment on our salespeople data. Figure 3.1 shows the results of taking 10, 100 and 1000 different random samples of 50, 100 and 150 salespeople from the salespeople data set and creating a histogram of the resulting mean sales values. We can see how greater numbers of samples (down the rows) lead to a more normal distribution curve and larger sample sizes (across the columns) lead to a ‘spikier’ distribution with a smaller standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Histogram and density of mean sales from the salespeople data set based on sample sizes of 50, 100 and 150 (columns) and 10, 100 and 1000 samplings (rows)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Standard errors, the \\(t\\)-distribution and confidence intervals\nOne consequence of the observations in Figure 3.1 is that the summary statistics calculated from larger sample sizes fall into distributions that are ‘narrower’ and hence represent more precise estimations of the population statistic. The standard deviation of a sampled statistic is called the standard error of that statistic. In the special case of a sampled mean, the formula for the standard error of the mean can be derived to be\n\\[\nSE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the (sample) standard deviation and \\(n\\) is the sample size1. This confirms that the standard error of the mean decreases with greater sample size, confirming our intuition that the estimation of the mean is more precise with larger samples.\nTo apply this logic to our salespeople data set, let’s take a random sample of 100 values of customer_rate.\n\n# set seed for reproducibility of sampling\nset.seed(123)\n\n# generate a sample of 100 observations\ncustrate &lt;- na.omit(salespeople$customer_rate)\nn &lt;- 100\nsample_custrate &lt;- sample(custrate, n)\n\nWe can calculate the mean of the sample and the standard error of the mean.\n\n# mean\n(sample_mean &lt;- mean(sample_custrate))\n\n[1] 3.6485\n\n# standard error\n(se &lt;- sd(sample_custrate)/sqrt(n))\n\n[1] 0.08494328\n\n\nBecause the normal distribution is a frequency (or probability) distribution, we can interpret the standard error as a fundamental unit of ‘sensitivity’ around the sample mean. For greater multiples of standard errors around the sample mean, we can have greater certainty that the range contains the true population mean.\nTo calculate how many standard errors we would need around the sample mean to have a 95% probability of including the true population mean, we need to use the \\(t\\)-distribution. The \\(t\\)-distribution is essentially an approximation of the normal distribution acknowledging that we only have a sample estimate of the true population standard deviation in how we calculate the standard error. In this case where we are dealing with a single sample mean, we use the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. We can use the qt() function in R to find the standard error multiple associated with the level of certainty we need. In this case, we are looking for our true population mean to be outside the top 2.5% or bottom 2.5% of the distribution2.\n\n# get se multiple for 0.975\n(t &lt;- qt(p = 0.975, df = n - 1))\n\n[1] 1.984217\n\n\nWe see that approximately 1.98 standard errors on either side of our sample mean will give us 95% confidence that our range contains the true population mean. This is called the 95% confidence interval3.\n\n# 95% confidence interval lower and upper bounds\nlower_bound &lt;- sample_mean - t*se\nupper_bound &lt;- sample_mean + t*se\n\ncat(paste0('[', lower_bound, ', ', upper_bound, ']')) \n\n[3.47995410046738, 3.81704589953262]",

    "section": "3.3 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "3.3 Hypothesis testing\nObservations about the distribution of statistics on samples of random variables allow us to construct tests for hypotheses of difference or similarity. Such hypothesis testing is useful in itself for simple bivariate analysis in practice settings, but it will be particularly critical in later chapters in determining whether models are useful or not. Before we go through some technical examples of hypothesis testing, let’s overview the logic and intuition for how hypothesis testing works.\nThe purpose of hypothesis testing is to establish a high degree of statistical certainty regarding a claim of difference in a population based on the properties of a sample. Consistent with a high burden of proof, we start from the hypothesis that there is no difference, called the null hypothesis. We only reject the null hypothesis if the statistical properties of the sample data render it very unlikely, in which case we confirm the alternative hypothesis that a statistical difference does exist in the population.\nMost hypothesis tests can return a p-value, which is the maximum probability of finding the sample results (or results that are more extreme or unusual than the sample results) when the null hypothesis is true for the population. The analyst must decide on the level of p-value needed to reject the null hypothesis. This threshold is referred to as the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha). A common standard is to set \\(\\alpha\\) at 0.05. That is, we reject the null hypothesis if the p-value that we find for our sample results is less than 0.05. If we reject the null hypothesis at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), this means that the results we observe in the sample are so extreme or unusual that they would only occur by chance at most 1 in 20 times if the null hypothesis were true. An alpha of 0.05 is not the only standard of certainty used in research and practice, and in some fields of study smaller alphas are the norm, particularly if erroneous conclusions might have very serious consequences.\nThree of the most common types of hypothesis tests are4:\n\nTesting for a difference in the means of two groups\nTesting for a non-zero correlation between two variables\nTesting for a difference in frequency distributions between different categories\n\nWe will go through an example of each of these. In each case, you will see a three-step process. First, we calculate a test statistic. Second, we determine an expected distribution for that test statistic. Finally, we determine where our calculated statistic falls in that distribution in order to assess the likelihood of our sample occurring if the null hypothesis is true. During these examples, we will go through all the logic and calculation steps needed to do the hypothesis testing, before we demonstrate the simple functions that perform all the steps for you in R. Readers don’t absolutely need to know all the details contained in this section, but a strong understanding of the underlying methods is encouraged.\n\n3.3.1 Testing for a difference in means (Welch’s \\(t\\)-test)\nImagine that we are asked if, in general, the sales of low-performing salespeople are different from the sales of high-performing salespeople. This question refers to all salespeople, but we only have data for the sample in our salespeople data set. Let’s take two subsets of our data for those with a performance rating of 1 and those with a performance rating of 4, and calculate the difference in mean sales.\n\n# take two performance group samples \nperf1 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = performance == 1)\nperf4 &lt;- subset(salespeople, subset = performance == 4)\n\n# calculate the difference in mean sales\n(diff &lt;- mean(perf4$sales) - mean(perf1$sales))\n\n[1] 154.9742\n\n\nWe can see that those with a higher performance rating in our sample did generate higher mean sales than those with a lower performance rating. But these are just samples, and we are being asked to give a conclusion about the populations they are drawn from.\nLet’s take a null hypothesis that there is no difference in true mean sales between the two performance groups that these samples are drawn from. We combine the two samples and calculate the distribution around the difference in means. To reject the null hypothesis at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), we would need to determine that the 95% confidence interval of this distribution does not contain zero.\nWe calculate the standard error of the combined sample using the formula5:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf1}}^2}{n_{\\mathrm{perf1}}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf4}}^2}{n_{\\mathrm{perf4}}}}\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf1}}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{perf4}}\\) are the standard deviations of the two samples and \\(n_{\\mathrm{perf1}}\\) and \\(n_{\\mathrm{perf4}}\\) are the two sample sizes.\nWe use a special formula called the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation to calculate the degrees of freedom for the two samples, which in this case calculates to 100.986. This allows us to construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means, and we can test whether this contains zero.\n\n# calculate standard error of the two sets\nse &lt;- sqrt(sd(perf1$sales)^2/length(perf1$sales) \n           + sd(perf4$sales)^2/length(perf4$sales))\n\n# calculate the required t-statistic\nt &lt;- qt(p = 0.975, df = 100.98)\n\n# calculate 95% confidence interval\n(lower_bound &lt;- diff - t*se)\n\n[1] 88.56763\n\n(upper_bound &lt;- diff + t*se)\n\n[1] 221.3809\n\n# test if zero is inside this interval\n(0 &lt;= upper_bound) & (0 &gt;= lower_bound)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nSince this has returned FALSE, we conclude that a mean difference of zero is outside the 95% confidence interval of our sample mean difference, and so we cannot have 95% certainty that the difference in population means is zero. We reject the null hypothesis that the mean sales of both performance levels are the same.\nLooking at this graphically, we are assuming a \\(t\\)-distribution of the mean difference, and we are determining where zero sits in that distribution, as in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: \\(t\\)-distribution of the mean sales difference between perf1 and perf4, 95% confidence intervals (red dashed lines) and a zero difference (blue dot-dash line)\n\n\n\nThe red dashed lines in this diagram represent the 95% confidence interval around the mean difference of our two samples. The ‘tails’ of the curve outside of these two lines each represent a maximum of 0.025 probability for the true population mean. So we can see that the position of the blue dot-dashed line can correspond to a maximum probability that the population mean difference is zero. This is the p-value of the hypothesis test7.\nThe p-value can be derived by calculating the standard error multiple associated with zero in the \\(t\\)-distribution (called the \\(t\\)-statistic or \\(t\\)-value), by applying the conversion function pt() to obtain the upper tail probability and then multiplying by 2 to get the probability associated with both tails of the distribution.\n\n# get t-statistic\nt_actual &lt;- diff/se \n\n# convert t-statistic to p-value\n2*pt(t_actual, df = 100.98, lower = FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.093212e-05\n\n\nNowadays, it is never necessary to do these manual calculations ourselves because hypothesis tests are a standard part of statistical software. In R, the t.test() function performs a hypothesis test of difference in means of two samples and confirms our manually calculated p-value and 95% confidence interval.\n\nt.test(perf4$sales, perf1$sales)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  perf4$sales and perf1$sales\nt = 4.6295, df = 100.98, p-value = 1.093e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  88.5676 221.3809\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 619.8909  464.9167 \n\n\nBecause our p-value is less than our alpha of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The standard \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is associated with the term statistically significant. Therefore we could say here that the two performance groups have a statistically significant difference in mean sales.\nIn practice, there are numerous alphas that are of interest to analysts, each reflecting different levels of certainty. While 0.05 is the most common standard in many disciplines, more stringent alphas of 0.01 and 0.001 are often used in situations where a high degree of certainty is desirable (for example, some medical fields). Similarly, a less stringent alpha standard of 0.1 can be of interest particularly when sample sizes are small and the analyst is satisfied with ‘indications’ from the data. In many statistical software packages, including those that we will see in this book, tests that meet an \\(\\alpha = 0.1\\) standard are usually marked with period(.), those that meet \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) with an asterisk(*), \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) a double asterisk(**) and \\(\\alpha = 0.001\\) a triple asterisk(***).\nMany leading statisticians have argued that p-values are more a test of sample size than anything else and have cautioned against too much of a focus on p-values in making statistical conclusions from data. In particular, situations where data and methodology have been deliberately manipulated to achieve certain alpha standards—a process known as ‘p-hacking’—has been of increasing concern recently. See ?sec-power-tests for a better understanding of how the significance level and the sample size contribute to determining statistical power in hypothesis testing.\n\n\n3.3.2 Testing for a non-zero correlation between two variables (\\(t\\)-test for correlation)\nImagine that we are given a sample of data for two variables and we are asked if the variables are correlated in the overall population. We can take a null hypothesis that the variables are not correlated, determine a t-statistic associated with a zero correlation and convert this to a p-value. The t-statistic associated with a correlation \\(r\\) between two samples of length \\(n\\) is often notated \\(t^*\\) and is defined as\n\\[\nt^* = \\frac{r\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}\n\\] \\(t^*\\) can be converted to an associated p-value using a \\(t\\)-distribution in a similar way to the previous section, this time with \\(n - 2\\) degrees of freedom in our \\(t\\)-distribution. As an example, let’s calculate \\(t^*\\) for the correlation between sales and customer rating in our sample and convert it to a p-value.\n\n# remove NAs from salespeople\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# calculate t_star\nr &lt;- cor(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate)\nn &lt;- nrow(salespeople)\nt_star &lt;- (r*sqrt(n - 2))/sqrt(1 - r^2)\n\n# convert to p-value on t-distribution with n - 2 degrees of freedom\n2*pt(t_star, df = n - 2, lower = FALSE)\n\n[1] 8.647952e-11\n\n\nAgain, there is a useful function in R to cut out the need for all our manual calculations. The cor.test() function in R performs a hypothesis test on the null hypothesis that two variables have zero correlation.\n\ncor.test(salespeople$sales, salespeople$customer_rate)\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  salespeople$sales and salespeople$customer_rate\nt = 6.6952, df = 348, p-value = 8.648e-11\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2415282 0.4274964\nsample estimates:\n     cor \n0.337805 \n\n\nThis confirms our manual calculations, and we see the null hypothesis has been rejected and we can conclude that there is a significant correlation between sales and customer rating.\n\n\n3.3.3 Testing for a difference in frequency distribution between different categories in a data set (Chi-square test)\nImagine that we are asked if the performance category of each person in the salespeople data set has a relationship with their promotion likelihood. We will test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the distribution of promoted versus not promoted across the four performance categories.\nFirst we can produce a contingency table, which is a matrix containing counts of how many people were promoted or not promoted in each category.\n\n# create contingency table of promoted vs performance\n(contingency &lt;- table(salespeople$promoted, salespeople$performance))\n\n   \n     1  2  3  4\n  0 50 85 77 25\n  1 10 25 48 30\n\n\nWe can see by summing each row that for the total sample we can expect 113 people to be promoted and 237 to miss out on promotion. We can use this ratio to compute an expected proportion in each performance category under the assumption that the distribution was exactly the same across all four categories.\n\n# calculate expected promoted and not promoted\n(expected_promoted &lt;- (sum(contingency[2, ])/sum(contingency)) * \n   colSums(contingency))\n\n       1        2        3        4 \n19.37143 35.51429 40.35714 17.75714 \n\n(expected_notpromoted &lt;- (sum(contingency[1, ])/sum(contingency)) * \n    colSums(contingency))\n\n       1        2        3        4 \n40.62857 74.48571 84.64286 37.24286 \n\n\nNow we can compare our observed versus expected values using the difference metric:\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\mathrm{observed} - \\mathrm{expected})^2}{\\mathrm{expected}}\n\\] and add these all up to get a total, known as the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic.\n\n# calculate the difference metrics for promoted and not promoted\npromoted &lt;- sum((expected_promoted - contingency[2, ])^2/\n                  expected_promoted)\n\nnotpromoted &lt;- sum((expected_notpromoted - contingency[1, ])^2/\n                     expected_notpromoted)\n\n# calculate chi-squared statistic\n(chi_sq_stat &lt;- notpromoted + promoted)\n\n[1] 25.89541\n\n\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic has an expected distribution that can be used to determine the p-value associated with this statistic. As with the \\(t\\)-distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. This is calculated by subtracting one from the number of rows and from the number of columns in the contingency table and multiplying them together. In this case we have 2 rows and 4 columns, which calculates to 3 degrees of freedom. Armed with our \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic and our degrees of freedom, we can now calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test using the pchisq() function.\n\n# calculate p-value from chi_squared stat\npchisq(chi_sq_stat, df = 3, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.003063e-05\n\n\nThe chisq.test() function in R performs all the steps involved in a chi-square test of independence on a contingency table and returns the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic and associated p-value for the null hypothesis, in this case confirming our manual calculations.\n\nchisq.test(contingency)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency\nX-squared = 25.895, df = 3, p-value = 1.003e-05\n\n\nAgain, we can reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference in the distribution of promoted/not promoted individuals between the four performance categories.",

Linear regression will often be the first methodology to be trialed on a given problem, and will give an immediate benchmark with which to judge the efficacy of other, more complex, modeling techniques. Given the ease of interpretation, many analysts will select a linear regression model over more complex approaches even if those approaches produce a slightly better fit.

    "text": "4.1.1 Origins and intuition of linear regression\nLinear regression, also known as Ordinary Least Squares linear regression or OLS regression for short, was developed independently by the mathematicians Gauss and Legendre at or around the first decade of the 19th century, and there remains today some controversy about who should take credit for its discovery. However, at the time of its discovery it was not actually known as ‘regression’‍. This term became more popular following the work of Francis Galton—a British intellectual jack-of-all-trades and a cousin of Charles Darwin. In the late 1800s, Galton had researched the relationship between the heights of a population of almost 1000 children and the average height of their parents (mid-parent height). He was surprised to discover that there was not a perfect relationship between the height of a child and the average height of its parents, and that in general children’s heights were more likely to be in a range that was closer to the mean for the total population. He described this statistical phenomenon as a ‘regression towards mediocrity’ (‘regression’ comes from a Latin term approximately meaning ‘go back’).\nFigure 4.1 is a scatter plot of Galton’s data with the black solid line showing what a perfect relationship would look like, the black dot-dashed line indicating the mean child height and the red dashed line showing the actual relationship determined by Galton1. You can regard the red dashed line as ‘going back’ from the perfect relationship (symbolized by the black line). This might give you an intuition that will help you understand later sections of this chapter. In an arbitrary data set, the red dashed line can lie anywhere between the black dot-dashed line (no relationship) and the black solid line (a perfect relationship). Linear regression is about finding the red dashed line in your data and using it to explain the degree to which your input data (the \\(x\\) axis) explains your outcome data (the \\(y\\) axis).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Galton’s study of the height of children introduced the term ‘regression’\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Use cases for linear regression\nLinear regression is particularly suited to a problem where the outcome of interest is on some sort of continuous scale (for example, quantity, money, height, weight). For outcomes of this type, it can be a first port of call before trying more complex modeling approaches. It is simple and easy to explain, and analysts will often accept a somewhat poorer fit using linear regression in order to avoid having to interpret a more complex model.\nHere are some illustratory examples of questions that could be tackled with a linear regression approach:\n\nGiven a data set of demographic data, job data and current salary data, to what extent can current salary be explained by the rest of the data?\nGiven annual test scores for a set of students over a four-year period, what is the relationship between the final test score and earlier test scores?\nGiven a set of GPA data, SAT data and data on the percentile score on an aptitude test for a set of job applicants, to what extent can the GPA and SAT data explain the aptitude test score?\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are working as an analyst for the biology department of a large academic institution which offers a four-year undergraduate degree program. The academic leaders of the department are interested in understanding how student performance in the final-year examination of the degree program relates to performance in the prior three years.\nTo help with this, you have been provided with data for 975 individuals graduating in the past three years, and you have been asked to create a model to explain each individual’s final examination score based on their examination scores for the first three years of their program. The Year 1 examination scores are awarded on a scale of 0–100, Years 2 and 3 on a scale of 0–200, and the Final year is awarded on a scale of 0–300.\nWe will load the ugtests data set into our session and take a brief look at it.\n\n# if needed, download ugtests data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/ugtests.csv\"\nugtests &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# look at the first few rows of data\nhead(ugtests)\n\n  Yr1 Yr2 Yr3 Final\n1  27  50  52    93\n2  70 104 126   207\n3  27  36 148   175\n4  26  75 115   125\n5  46  77  75   114\n6  86 122 119   159\n\n\nThe data looks as expected, with test scores for four years all read in as numeric data types, but of course this is only a few rows.

We can also be assured that there is no missing data, as these would have been displayed as NA counts in our summary if they existed.\nWe can also plot our four years of test scores pairwise to see any initial relationships of interest, as displayed in Figure 4.2.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# display a pairplot of all four columns of data\nGGally::ggpairs(ugtests)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Pairplot of the ugtests data set\n\n\n\nIn the diagonal, we can see the distributions of the data in each column.

    "section": "4.2 Simple linear regression",
    "text": "4.2 Simple linear regression\nIn order to visualize our approach and improve our intuition, we will start with simple linear regression, which is the case where there is only a single input variable and outcome variable.\n\n4.2.1 Linear relationship between a single input and an outcome\nLet our input variable be \\(x\\) and our outcome variable be \\(y\\). In Chapter 1, we introduced the concept of parametric modeling as an assumption that our outcome variable \\(y\\) is expected to be related to the input variable \\(x\\) by means of some mathematically definable function. In other words, we assume:\n\\[\ny = f(x) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) is some mathematical transformation of \\(x\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is some random, uncontrollable error. Put another way, we assume that \\(f(x)\\) represents the mean expected value of \\(y\\) over many observations of \\(x\\), and that any single observation of \\(y\\) could vary from \\(f(x)\\) by an error of \\(\\epsilon\\). Since we are assuming that \\(f(x)\\) represents the mean of \\(y\\), our errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are therefore distributed around a mean of zero. We further assume that the distribution of our errors \\(\\epsilon\\) is a normal distribution2.\nRecalling the equation of a straight line, because we assume that the expected relationship is linear, it will take the form:\n\\[y = mx + c\\] where \\(m\\) represents the slope or gradient of the line, and \\(c\\) represents the point at which the line intercepts the \\(y\\) axis. When using a straight line to model a relationship in the data, we call \\(c\\) and \\(m\\) the coefficients of the model.\nNow let’s assume that we have a sample of 10 observations with which to estimate our linear relationship. Let’s take the first 10 values of Yr3 and Final in our ugtests data set:\n\n(d &lt;- head(ugtests[ , c(\"Yr3\", \"Final\")], 10))\n\n   Yr3 Final\n1   52    93\n2  126   207\n3  148   175\n4  115   125\n5   75   114\n6  119   159\n7  125   153\n8   78    84\n9  119   147\n10  67    80\n\n\nWe can do a simple plot of these observations as in Figure 4.3. Intuitively, we can imagine a line passing through these points that ‘fits’ the general pattern. For example, taking \\(m = 1.2\\) and \\(c = 5\\), the resulting line \\(y = 1.2x + 5\\) could fit between the points we are given, as displayed in Figure 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Basic scatter plot of 10 observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Fitting \\(y=1.2x + 5\\) to our 10 observations\n\n\n\nThis looks like an approximation of the relationship, but how do we know that it is the best approximation?\n\n\n4.2.2 Minimising the error\nRemember that our assumed relationship \\(y = mx + c\\) represents the expected mean value of \\(y\\) over many observations of \\(x\\). For a specific single observation of \\(x\\), we do not expect \\(y\\) to be precisely on our expected line, because each individual observation will have an error term \\(\\epsilon\\) either above or below the expected line. We can determine this error term \\(\\epsilon\\) in the fitted model by calculating the difference between the real value of \\(y\\) and the one predicted by our model. For example, at \\(x = 52\\), our modeled value of y is 67.4, but the real value is 93, producing an error \\(\\epsilon\\) of 25.6. These errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are known as the residuals of our model. The residuals for the 10 points in our data set are illustrated by the solid red line segments in Figure 4.5. It looks like at least one of our residuals is pretty large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Residuals of \\(y=1.2x + 5\\) for our 10 observations\n\n\n\nThe error of our model—which we want to minimize—could be defined in a number of ways:\n\nThe average of our residuals\nThe average of the absolute values of our residuals (so that negative values are converted to positive values)\nThe average of the squares of our residuals (note that all squares are positive)\n\nFor a number of reasons (not least the fact that at the time this method was developed it was one of the easiest to derive), the most common approach is number 3, which is why we call our regression model Ordinary Least Squares regression. Some algebra and calculus can help us determine the equation of the line that generates the least-squared residual error. For more of the theory behind this, consult Montgomery, Peck, and Vining (2012), but let’s look at how this works in practice.\n\n\n4.2.3 Determining the best fit\nWe can run a fairly simple function in R to calculate the best fit linear model for our data. Once we have run that function, the model and all the details will be saved in our session for further investigation or use.\nFirst we need to express the model we are looking to calculate as a formula. In this simple case, we want to regress the outcome \\(y =\\) Final against the input \\(x =\\) Yr3, and therefore we would use the simple formula notation Final ~ Yr3. Now we can use the lm() function to calculate the linear model based on our data set and our formula.\n\n# calculate model\nmodel &lt;- lm(formula = Final ~ Yr3, data = d)\n\nThe model object that we have created is a list of a number of different pieces of information, which we can see by looking at the names of the objects in the list.\n\n# view the names of the objects in the model\nnames(model) \n\n [1] \"coefficients\"  \"residuals\"     \"effects\"       \"rank\"         \n [5] \"fitted.values\" \"assign\"        \"qr\"            \"df.residual\"  \n [9] \"xlevels\"       \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"model\"        \n\n\nSo we can already see some terms we are familiar with. For example, we can look at the coefficients.\n\nmodel$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)         Yr3 \n  16.630452    1.143257 \n\n\nThis tells us that that our best fit model—the one that minimizes the average squares of the residuals—is \\(y = 1.14x + 16.63\\). In other words, our Final test score can be expected to take a value of 16.63 even with zero score in the Yr3 input, and every additional point scored in Yr3 will increase the Final score by 1.14.\n\n\n4.2.4 Measuring the fit of the model\nWe have calculated a model which minimizes the average squared residual error for the sample of data that we have, but we don’t really have a sense of how ‘good’ the model is. How do we tell how well our model uses the input data to explain the outcome? This is an important question to answer because you would not want to propose a model that does not do a good job of explaining your outcome, and you also may need to compare your model to other alternatives, which will require some sort of benchmark metric.\nOne natural way to benchmark how good a job your model does of explaining the outcome is to compare it to a situation where you have no input and no model at all. In this situation, all you have is your outcome values, which can be considered a random variable with a mean and a variance. In the case of our 10 observations, we have 10 values of Final with a mean of 133.7. We can consider the horizontal line representing the mean of \\(y\\) as our ‘random model’‍, and we can calculate the residuals around the mean. This can be seen in Figure 4.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Residuals of our 10 observations around their mean value\n\n\n\nRecall from Section 3.1.1 the definition of the population variance of \\(y\\), notated as \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y)\\). Note that it is defined as the average of the squares of the residuals around the mean of \\(y\\). Therefore \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y)\\) represents the average squared residual error of a random model. This calculates in this case to 1574.21. Let’s overlay our fitted model onto this random model in Figure 4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Comparison of residuals of fitted model (red) against random variable (blue)\n\n\n\nSo for most of our observations (though not all) we seem to have reduced the ‘distance’ from the random model by fitting our new model. If we average the square of our residuals for the fitted model, we obtain the average squared residual error of our fitted model, which calculates to 398.35.\nTherefore, before we fit our model, we have an error of 1574.21, and after we fit it, we have an error of 398.35. So we have reduced the error of our model by 1175.86 or, expressed as a proportion, by 0.75. In other words, we can say that our model explains 0.75 (or 75%) of the variance of our outcome.\nThis metric is known as the \\(R^2\\) of our model and is the primary metric used in measuring the fit of a linear regression model3.",

    "section": "4.3 Multiple linear regression",
    "text": "4.3 Multiple linear regression\nIn reality, regression problems rarely involve one single input variable, but rather multiple variables. The methodology for multiple linear regression is similar in nature to simple linear regression, but obviously more difficult to visualize because of its increased dimensionality.\nIn this case, our inputs are a set of \\(p\\) variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p\\). Extending the linear equation in Section 4.2.1, we seek to develop an equation of the form:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_px_p\\] so that our average squared residual error is minimized.\n\n4.3.1 Running a multiple linear regression model and interpreting its coefficients\nA multiple linear regression model is run in a similar way to a simple linear regression model, with your formula notation determining what outcome and input variables you wish to have in your model. Let’s now perform a multiple linear regression on our entire ugtests data set and regress our Final test score against all prior test scores using the formula Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1 and determine our coefficients as before.\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1)\nmodel$coefficients\n\n(Intercept)         Yr3         Yr2         Yr1 \n14.14598945  0.86568123  0.43128539  0.07602621 \n\n\nReferring to our formula in Section 4.3, let’s understand what each coefficient \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) means. \\(\\beta_0\\), the intercept of the model, represents the value of \\(y\\) assuming that all the inputs were zero. You can imagine that your output can be expected to have a base value even without any inputs—a student who completely flunked the first three years can still redeem themselves to some extent in the Final year.\nNow looking at the other coefficients, let’s consider what happens if our first input \\(x_1\\) increased by a single unit, assuming nothing else changed. We would then expect our value of y to increase by \\(\\beta_1\\). Similarly for any input \\(x_k\\), a unit increase would result in an increase in \\(y\\) of \\(\\beta_k\\), assuming no other changes in the inputs.\nIn the case of our ugtests data set, we can say the following:\n\nThe intercept of the model is 14.146. This is the value that a student could be expected to score on their final exam even if they had scored zero in all previous exams.\nThe Yr3 coefficient is 0.866. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 3 score.\nThe Yr2 coefficient is 0.431. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 2 score.\nThe Yr1 coefficient is 0.076. Assuming no change in other inputs, this is the increase in the Final exam score that could be expected from an extra point in the Year 1 score.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Coefficient confidence\nIntuitively, these coefficients appear too precise for comfort. After all, we are attempting to estimate a relationship based on a limited set of data. In particular, looking at the Yr1 coefficient, it seems to be very close to zero, implying that there is a possibility that the Year 1 examination score has no impact on the final examination score. Like in any statistical estimation, the coefficients calculated for our model have a margin of error. Typically, in any such situation, we seek to know a 95% confidence interval to set a standard of certainty around the values we are interpreting.\nThe summary() function is a useful way to gather critical information in your model, including important statistics on your coefficients:\n\nmodel_summary &lt;- summary(model)\nmodel_summary$coefficients\n\n               Estimate Std. Error   t value      Pr(&gt;|t|)\n(Intercept) 14.14598945 5.48005618  2.581358  9.986880e-03\nYr3          0.86568123 0.02913754 29.710169 1.703293e-138\nYr2          0.43128539 0.03250783 13.267124  4.860109e-37\nYr1          0.07602621 0.06538163  1.162807  2.451936e-01\n\n\nThe 95% confidence interval corresponds to approximately two standard errors above or below the estimated value. For a given coefficient, if this confidence interval includes zero, you cannot reject the hypothesis that the variable has no relationship with the outcome. Another indicator of this is the Pr(&gt;|t|) column of the coefficient summary, which represents the p-value of the null hypothesis that the input variable has no relationship with the outcome. If this value is less than a certain threshold (usually 0.05), you can conclude that this variable has a statistically significant relationship with the outcome. To see the precise confidence intervals for your model coefficients, you can use the confint() function.\n\nconfint(model)\n\n                  2.5 %     97.5 %\n(Intercept)  3.39187185 24.9001071\nYr3          0.80850142  0.9228610\nYr2          0.36749170  0.4950791\nYr1         -0.05227936  0.2043318\n\n\nIn this case, we can conclude that the examinations in Years 2 and 3 have a significant relationship with the Final examination score, but we cannot conclude this for Year 1. Effectively, this means that we can drop Yr1 from our model with no substantial loss of fit. In general, simpler models are easier to manage and interpret, so let’s remove the non-significant variable now.\n\nnewmodel &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2)\n\nGiven that our new model only has three dimensions, we have the luxury of visualizing it. Interactive Figure 4.9 shows the data and the fitted plane of our model.\n\n\n\n#| fig.align: \"center\"\n#| echo: false\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nplot_ly(data = ugtests) |&gt;\n  add_trace(x = ~Yr3, y = ~Yr2, z = ~Final, mode = \"markers\", type = \"scatter3d\",\n            marker = list(size = 5, color = \"blue\", symbol = 104), name = \"Observations\") |&gt; \n  add_trace(z = newmodel$fitted.values, x = ~Yr3, y = ~Yr2, type = \"mesh3d\", \n            name = \"Fitted values\") |&gt;\n  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Yr3'), yaxis = list(title = 'Yr2'),\n                      camera = list(eye = list(x = -1.5, y = 1.75, z = 0)),\n                      zaxis = list(title = 'Final'), aspectmode='cube')) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: 3D visualization of the fitted newmodel against the ugtests data\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Model ‘goodness-of-fit’\nAt this point we can further explore the overall summary of our model. As you saw in the previous section, our model summary contains numerous objects of interest, including statistics on the coefficients of our model. We can see what is inside our summary by looking at the names of its contents, and we can then dive in and explore specific objects of interest.\n\n# get summary of model\nnewmodel_summary &lt;- summary(newmodel)\n\n# see summary contents\nnames(newmodel_summary)\n\n [1] \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"residuals\"     \"coefficients\" \n [5] \"aliased\"       \"sigma\"         \"df\"            \"r.squared\"    \n [9] \"adj.r.squared\" \"fstatistic\"    \"cov.unscaled\" \n\n\n\n# view r-squared\nnewmodel_summary$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.5296734\n\n\nWe can see that our model explains more than half of the variance in the Final examination score. Alternatively, we can view the entire summary to receive a formatted report on our model.\n\n# see full model summary\nnewmodel_summary\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2, data = ugtests)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-91.12 -20.36  -0.22  18.94  98.29 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In particular, the last line gives us a report on our overall model confidence or ‘goodness-of-fit’—this is a hypothesis test on the null hypothesis that our model does not fit the data any better than a random model. A high F-statistic indicates a strong likelihood that the model fits the data better than a random model. More intuitively, perhaps, we also have the p-value for the F-statistic. In this case it is extremely small, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our model has significant explanatory power over and above a random model.\nBe careful not to confuse model goodness-of-fit with \\(R^2\\). Depending on your sample, it is entirely possible for a model with a low \\(R^2\\) to have high certainty for goodness-of-fit and vice versa.\n\n\n4.3.4 Making predictions from your model\nWhile this book focuses on inferential rather than predictive analytics, we briefly touch here on the mechanics of generating predictions from models. As you might imagine, once the model has been fitted, prediction is a relatively straightforward process. We feed the Yr2 and Yr3 examination scores into our fitted model, and it applies the coefficients to calculate the predicted outcome. Let’s look at three fictitious students and create a dataframe with their scores to input into the model.\n\n(new_students &lt;- data.frame(\n  Yr2 = c(67, 23, 88), \n  Yr3 = c(144, 100, 166)\n))\n\n  Yr2 Yr3\n1  67 144\n2  23 100\n3  88 166\n\n\nNow we can feed these values into our model to get predictions of the Final examination result for our three new students.\n\n# use newmodel to predict for new_students\npredict(newmodel, new_students)\n\n       1        2        3 \n171.6093 114.5273 199.7179 \n\n\nBecause we are modeling the expected value of the Final examination result, this prediction represents the expected mean over many students with the same scores in previous years examinations. We know from our earlier work in this chapter that there is a confidence interval around the coefficients of our model, which means that there is a range of values for our expected Final score according to those confidence intervals. This can be determined by specifying that you require a confidence interval for your predictions.\n\n# get a confidence interval \npredict(newmodel, new_students, interval = \"confidence\")\n\n       fit      lwr      upr\n1 171.6093 168.2125 175.0061\n2 114.5273 109.7081 119.3464\n3 199.7179 195.7255 203.7104\n\n\nAs an example, another way of interpreting the confidence interval is to say that, if you have many students who scored precisely 67 and 144 in the Year 2 and Year 3 examinations respectively, we expect the mean Final score of these students to be somewhere between 168 and 175.\nYou may also recall from Section 4.2.1 that any prediction of an individual observation is subject to an error term \\(\\epsilon\\). Therefore, to generate a more reliable prediction range for an individual observation, you should calculate a ‘prediction interval’‍.\n\n# get a prediction interval \npredict(newmodel, new_students, interval = \"prediction\")\n\n       fit       lwr      upr\n1 171.6093 111.77795 231.4406\n2 114.5273  54.59835 174.4562\n3 199.7179 139.84982 259.5860\n\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the process of developing a model to predict an outcome can be quite different from developing a model to explain an outcome. For a start, it is unlikely that you would use your entire sample to fit a predictive model, as you would want to reserve a portion of your data to test for its fit on new data. Since the focus of this book is inferential modeling, much of this topic will be out of our scope.",

    "section": "4.4 Managing inputs in linear regression",
    "text": "4.4 Managing inputs in linear regression\nOur walkthrough example for this chapter, while useful for illustrating the key concepts, is a very straightforward data set to run a model on. There is no missing data, and all the data inputs have the same numeric data type (in the exercises at the end of this chapter we will present a more varied data set for analysis). Commonly, an analyst will have a list of possible input variables that they can consider in their model, and rarely will they run a model using all of these variables. In this section we will cover some common elements of decision making and design of input variables in regression models.\n\n4.4.1 Relevance of input variables\nThe first step in managing your input variables is to make a judgment about their relevance to the outcome being modeled. Analysts should not blindly run a model on a set of variables before considering their relevance. There are two common reasons for rejecting the inclusion of an input variable:\n\nThere is no reasonable possibility of a direct or indirect causal relationship between the input and the outcome. For example, if you were provided with the height of each individual taking the Final examination in our walkthrough example, it would be difficult to see how that could reasonably relate to the outcome that you are modeling.\nIf there is a possibility that the model will be used to predict based on new data in the future, there may be variables that you explicitly do not wish to be used in any prediction. For example, if our walkthrough model contained student gender data, we would not want to include that in a model that predicted future student scores because we would not want gender to be taken into consideration when determining student performance.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Sparseness (‘missingness’) of data\nMissing data is a very common problem in modeling. If an observation has missing data in a variable that is being included in the model, that observation will be ignored, or an error will be thrown. This forces a model trained on a smaller set of data, which can compromise its powers of inference. Running summary functions on your data (such as summary() in R) will reveal variables that contain missing data if they exist.\nThere are three main options for how missing data is handled:\n\nIf the data for a given variable is relatively complete and only a small number of observations are missing, it’s usually best and simplest to remove the observations that are missing from the data set. Note that many modeling functions (though not all) will take care of this automatically.\nAs data becomes more sparse, removing observations becomes less of an option. If the sparseness is massive (for example, more than half of the data is missing), then there is no choice but to remove that variable from the model. While this may be unsatisfactory for a given variable (because it is thought to have an important explanatory role), the fact remains that data that is mostly missing is not a good measure of a construct in the first place.\nModerate sparse data could be considered for imputation. Imputation methods involve using the overall statistical properties of the entire data set or of specific other variables to ‘suggest’ what the missing value might be, ranging from simple mean and median values to more complex imputation methods. Imputation methods are more commonly used in predictive settings, and we will not cover imputation methods in depth here.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Transforming categorical inputs to dummy variables\nMany models will have categorical inputs rather than numerical inputs. Categorical inputs usually take forms such as:\n\nBinary values—for example, Yes/No, True/False\nUnordered categories—for example Car, Train, Bicycle\nOrdered categories—for example Low, Medium, High\n\nCategorical variables do not behave like numerical variables. There is no sense of quantity in a categorical variable. We do not know how a Car relates to a Train quantitatively, we only know that they are different. Even for an ordered category, although we know that ‘Medium’ is higher than ‘Low’‍, we do not know how much higher or indeed whether the difference is the same as that between ‘High’ and ‘Medium’‍.\nIn general, all model input variables should take a numeric form. The most reliable way to do this is to convert categorical values to dummy variables. While some packages and functions have a built-in ability to convert categorical data to dummy variables, not all do, so it is important to know how to do this yourself. Consider the following data set:\n\n(vehicle_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  make = factor(c(\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Audi\")), \n  manufacturing_cost = c(15000, 19000, 28000)\n))\n\n    make manufacturing_cost\n1   Ford              15000\n2 Toyota              19000\n3   Audi              28000\n\n\nThe make data is categorical, so it will be converted to several columns for each possible value of make, and binary labeling will be used to identify whether that value is present in that specific observation. Many packages and functions are available to conveniently do this, for example:\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n(dummy_vehicle &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(vehicle_data, \n                                           basal_level = TRUE))\n\n  make_Audi make_Ford make_Toyota manufacturing_cost\n1         0         1           0              15000\n2         0         0           1              19000\n3         1         0           0              28000\n\n\nIt is worth a moment to consider how to interpret coefficients of dummy variables in a linear regression model. Note that all observations will have one of the dummy variable values (all cars must have a make). Therefore the model will assume a ‘reference value’ for the categorical variable—often this is the first value in alphabetical or numerical order. In this case, Audi would be the reference dummy variable. The model then calculates the effect on the outcome variable of a ‘switch’ from Audi to one of the other dummies4. If we were to try to use the data in our vehicle_data_dummies data set to explain the retail price of a vehicle, we would interpret coefficients like this:\n\nComparing two cars of the same make, we would expect each extra dollar spent on manufacturing to change the retail price by …\nComparing a Ford with an Audi of the same manufacturing cost, we would expect a difference in retail price of …\nComparing a Toyota with an Audi of the same manufacturing cost, we would expect a difference in retail price of …\n\nThis highlights the importance of appropriate interpretation of coefficients, and in particular the proper understanding of units. It will be common to see much larger coefficients for dummy variables in regression models because they represent a binary ‘all’ or ‘nothing’ variable in the model. The coefficient for manufacturing cost would be much smaller because a unit in this case is a dollar of manufacturing spend, on a scale of many thousands of potential dollars in spend. Care should be taken not to ‘rank’ coefficients by their value. Higher coefficients in and of themselves do not imply greater importance5.",

    "section": "4.5 Testing your model assumptions",
    "text": "4.5 Testing your model assumptions\nAll modeling techniques have underlying assumptions about the data that they model and can generate inaccurate results when those assumptions do not hold true. Conscientious analysts will verify that these assumptions are satisfied before finalizing their modeling efforts. In this section we will outline some common checks of model assumptions when running linear regression models.\n\n4.5.1 Assumption of linearity and additivity\nLinear regression assumes that the relationship we are trying to model is linear and additive in nature. Therefore you can expect problems if you are using this approach to model a pattern that is not linear or additive.\nYou can check whether your linearity assumption was reasonable in a couple of ways. You can plot the true versus the predicted (fitted) values to see if they look correlated. You can see such a plot on our student examination model in Figure 4.10.\n\n\n\n\npredicted_values &lt;- newmodel$fitted.values\ntrue_values &lt;- ugtests$Final\n\n# plot true values against predicted values\nplot(predicted_values, true_values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Plot of true versus fitted/predicted student scores\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can plot the residuals of your model against the predicted values and look for the pattern of a random distribution (that is, no major discernible pattern) such as in Figure 4.11.\n\n\n\n\nresiduals &lt;- newmodel$residuals\n\n# plot residuals against predicted values\nplot(predicted_values, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Plot of residuals against fitted/predicted scores\n\n\n\nYou can also plot the residuals against each input variable as an extra check of independent randomness, looking for a reasonably random distribution in all cases. If you find that your residuals are following a clear pattern and are not random in nature, this is an indication that a linear model is not a good choice for your data.\n\n\n4.5.2 Assumption of constant error variance\nIt is assumed in a linear model that the errors or residuals are homoscedastic—this means that their variance is constant across the values of the input variables. If the errors of your model are heteroscedastic—that is, if they increase or decrease according to the value of the model inputs—this can lead to poor estimations and inaccurate inferences.\nWhile a simple plot of residuals against predicted values (such as in Figure 4.11) can give a quick indication on homoscedacity, to be thorough the residuals should be plotted against each input variable, and it should be verified that the range of the residuals remains broadly stable. In our student examination model, we can first plot the residuals against the values of Yr2 in Figure 4.12.\n\n\n\n\nYr2 &lt;- ugtests$Yr2\n\n# plot residuals against Yr2 values\nplot(Yr2, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Plot of residuals against Yr2 values\n\n\n\nWe see a pretty consistent range of values for the residuals in Figure 4.12. Similarly we can plot the residuals against the values of Yr3, as in Figure 4.13.\n\n\n\n\nYr3 &lt;- ugtests$Yr3\n\n# plot residuals against Yr3 values\nplot(Yr3, residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Plot of residuals against Yr3 values\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13 also shows a consistent range of values for the residuals, which reassures us that we have homoscedacity.\n\n\n4.5.3 Assumption of normally distributed errors\nRecall from Section 4.2.1 that one of the assumptions when we run a linear regression model is that the residuals of the model are normally distributed around a mean of zero. Therefore it is useful to check your data to see how well it fits these assumptions. If your data shows that the residuals have a substantially non-normal distribution, this may tell you something about your model and how well you can rely on it for accurate inferences or predictions.\nWhen residuals violate this assumption, it means that the ingoing mathematical premise of your model does not fully describe your data. Whether or not this is a big problem depends on the existing properties of your sample and on other model diagnostics. In models built on smaller samples, where hypothesis test criteria are only narrowly met, residual non-normality could present a significant challenge to the reliability of inferences and predictions. On models where hypothesis test criteria are very comfortably met, residual non-normality is less likely to be a problem (Lumley et al. (2002)). In any case, it is good practice to examine the distribution of your residuals so that you can refine or improve your model.\nThe quickest way to determine if residuals in your sample are consistent with a normal distribution is to run a quantile-quantile plot (or Q-Q plot) on the residuals. This will plot the observed quantiles of your sample against the theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution. The closer this plot looks like a perfect correlation, the more certain you can be that this normality assumption holds. An example for our student examination model is in Figure 4.14.\n\n\n\n\n# normal distribution qqplot of residuals\nqqnorm(newmodel$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Quantile-quantile plot of residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Avoiding high collinearity and multicollinearity between input variables\nIn multiple linear regression, the various input variables used can be considered ‘dimensions’ of the problem or model. In theory, we ideally expect dimensions to be independent and uncorrelated. Practically speaking, however, it’s very challenging in large data sets to ensure that every input variable is completely uncorrelated from another. For example, even in our limited ugtests data set we saw in Figure 4.2 that Yr2 and Yr3 examination scores are correlated to some degree.\nWhile some correlation between input variables can be expected and tolerated in linear regression models, high levels of correlation can result in significant inflation of coefficients and inaccurate estimates of p-values of coefficients.\nCollinearity means that two input variables are highly correlated. The definition of ‘high correlation’ is a matter of judgment, but as a rule of thumb correlations greater than 0.5 might be considered high and greater than 0.7 might be considered extreme. Creating a simple correlation matrix or a pairplot (such as Figure 4.2) can immediately surface high or extreme collinearity.\nMulticollinearity means that there is a linear relationship between more than two of the input variables. This may not always present itself in the form of high correlations between pairs of input variables, but may be seen by identifying ‘clusters’ of moderately correlated variables, or by calculating a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each input variable—where VIFs greater than 5 indicate high multicollinearity. Easy-to-use tests also exist in statistical software for identifying multicollinearity (for example the mctest package in R). Here is how we would test for multicollinearity in our student examination model.\n\nlibrary(mctest)\n\n# diagnose possible overall presence of multicollinearity\nmctest::omcdiag(newmodel)\n\n\nCall:\nmctest::omcdiag(mod = newmodel)\n\n\nOverall Multicollinearity Diagnostics\n\n                       MC Results detection\nDeterminant |X'X|:         0.9981         0\nFarrar Chi-Square:         1.8365         0\nRed Indicator:             0.0434         0\nSum of Lambda Inverse:     2.0038         0\nTheil's Method:           -0.5259         0\nCondition Number:          9.1952         0\n\n1 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is detected by the test \n0 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test\n\n\n\n# if necessary, diagnose specific multicollinear variables using VIF \nmctest::imcdiag(newmodel, method = \"VIF\")\n\n\nCall:\nmctest::imcdiag(mod = newmodel, method = \"VIF\")\n\n\n VIF Multicollinearity Diagnostics\n\n       VIF detection\nYr3 1.0019         0\nYr2 1.0019         0\n\nNOTE:  VIF Method Failed to detect multicollinearity\n\n\n0 --&gt; COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test\n\n===================================\n\n\nNote that collinearity and multicollinearity only affect the coefficients of the variables impacted, and do not affect other variables or the overall statistics and fit of a model. Therefore, if a model is being developed primarily to make predictions and there is little interest in using the model to explain a phenomenon, there may not be any need to address this issue at all. However, in inferential modeling the accuracy of the coefficients is very important, and so testing of multicollinearity is essential. In general, the best way to deal with collinear variables is to remove one of them from the model (usually the one that has the least significance in explaining the outcome).",

    "section": "4.6 Extending multiple linear regression",
    "text": "4.6 Extending multiple linear regression\nBy introducing some extensions of linear regression to relax the linear or additive assumptions, we can try to improve the overall fit of a model. It is rare for practitioners to extend linear regression models too greatly due to the negative impact this can have on interpretation, but simple extensions such as experimenting with interaction terms or quadratics are not uncommon. If you have an appetite to explore this topic more fully, I recommend Rao et al. (2008).\n\n4.6.1 Interactions between input variables\nRecall that our model of student examination scores took each year’s score as an independent input variable, and therefore we are making the assumption that the score obtained in each year acts independently and additively in predicting the Final score. However, it is very possible that several input variables act together in relation to the outcome. One way of modeling this is to include interaction terms in your model, which are new input variables formed as products of the original input variables.\nIn our student examination data in ugtests, we could consider extending our model to not only include the individual year examinations, but also to include the impact of combined changes across multiple years. For example, we could combine the impact of Yr2 and Yr3 examinations by multiplying them together in our model.\n\ninteraction_model &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, \n                        formula = Final ~ Yr2 + Yr3 + Yr2*Yr3)\nsummary(interaction_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Final ~ Yr2 + Yr3 + Yr2 * Yr3, data = ugtests)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-78.084 -18.284  -0.546  18.395  79.824 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Let’s take a moment to understand how to interpret this, since we note that some of the coefficients are now negative.\nOur model now includes two input variables and their interaction, so it can be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{Final} &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2} + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr3}\\mathrm{Yr2} \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr2})\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2} \\\\\n&= \\beta_0 + \\gamma\\mathrm{Yr3} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{Yr2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3\\mathrm{Yr2}\\). Therefore our model has coefficients which are not constant but change with the values of the input variables. We can conclude that the effect of an extra point in the examination in Year 3 will be different depending on how the student performed in Year 2. Visualizing this, we can see in Interactive Figure 4.16 that this non-constant term introduces a curvature to our fitted surface that aligns it a little more closely with the observations in our data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: 3D visualization of the fitted interaction_model against the ugtests data\n\n\nBy examining the shape of this curved plane, we can observe that the model considers trajectories in the Year 2 and Year 3 examination scores. Those individuals who have improved from one year to the next will perform better in this model than those who declined. To demonstrate, let’s look at the predicted scores from our interaction_model for someone who declined and for someone who improved from Year 2 to Year 3.\n\n# data frame with a declining and an improving observation\nobs &lt;- data.frame(\n  Yr2 = c(150, 75),\n  Yr3 = c(75, 150)\n)\n\npredict(interaction_model, obs)\n\n       1        2 \n127.5010 170.1047 \n\n\nThrough including the interaction effect, the model interprets declining examination scores more negatively than improving examination scores. These kinds of additional inferential insights may be of great interest. However, consider the impact on interpretability of modeling too many combinations of interactions. As always, there is a trade-off between intepretability and accuracy6.\nWhen running models with interaction terms, you can expect to see a hierarchy in the coefficients according to the level of the interaction. For example, single terms will usually generate higher coefficients than interactions of two terms, which will generate higher coefficients than interactions of three terms, and so on. Given this, whenever an interaction of terms is considered significant in a model, then the single terms contained in that interaction should automatically be regarded as significant.\n\n\n4.6.2 Quadratic and higher-order polynomial terms\nIn many situations the real underlying relationship between the outcome and the inputs may be non-linear. For example, if the underlying relationship was thought to be quadratic on a given input variable \\(x\\), then the formula would take the form \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2x^2\\). We can easily trial polynomial terms using our linear model technology.\nFor example, recall that we removed Yr1 data from our model because it was not significant when modeled linearly. We could test if a quadratic model on Yr1 helps improve our fit7:\n\n# add a quadratic term in Yr1\nquadratic_yr1_model &lt;- lm(data = ugtests, \n                          formula = Final ~ Yr3 + Yr2 + Yr1 + I(Yr1^2))\n\n# test R-squared\nsummary(quadratic_yr1_model)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.5304198\n\n\nIn this case we find that modeling Yr1 as a quadratic makes no difference to the fit of the model.",

    "text": "5.1 When to use it\nIn the previous chapter we looked at how to explain outcomes that have continuous scale, such as quantity, money, height or weight. While there are a number of typical outcomes of this type in the people analytics domain, they are not the most common form of outcomes that are typically modeled. Much more common are situations where the outcome of interest takes the form of a limited set of classes. Binary (two class) problems are very common. Hiring, promotion and attrition are often modeled as binary outcomes: for example ‘Promoted’ or ‘Not promoted’. Multi-class outcomes like performance ratings on an ordinal scale, or survey responses on a Likert scale are often converted to binary outcomes by dividing the ratings into two groups, for example ‘High’ and ‘Not High’.\nIn any situation where our outcome is binary, we are effectively working with likelihoods. These are not generally linear in nature, and so we no longer have the comfort of our inputs being directly linearly related to our outcome. Therefore direct linear regression methods such as Ordinary Least Squares regression are not well suited to outcomes of this type. Instead, linear relationships can be inferred on transformations of the outcome variable, which gives us a path to building interpretable models. Hence, binomial logistic regression is said to be in a class of generalized linear models or GLMs. Understanding logistic regression and using it reliably in practice is not straightforward, but it is an invaluable skill to have in the people analytics domain. The mathematics of this chapter is a little more involved but worth the time investment in order to build a competent understanding of how to interpret these types of models.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Origins and intuition of binomial logistic regression\nThe logistic function was first introduced by the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst in the early 1800s as a tool for modeling population growth for humans, animals and certain species of plants and fruits. By this time, it was generally accepted that population growth could not continue exponentially forever, and that there were environmental and resource limits which place a maximum limit on the size of a population. The formula for Verhulst’s function was:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_0)}}\n\\] where \\(e\\) is the exponential constant, \\(x_0\\) is the value of \\(x\\) at the midpoint, \\(L\\) is the maximum value of \\(y\\) (known as the ‘carrying capacity’) and \\(k\\) is the maximum gradient of the curve.\nThe logistic function, as shown in Figure 5.1, was felt to accurately capture the theorized stages of population growth, with slower growth in the initial stage, moving to exponential growth during the intermediate stage and then to slower growth as the population approaches its carrying capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Verhulst’s logistic function modeled both the exponential nature and the natural limit of population growth\n\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, starting with applications in economics and in chemistry, the logistic function was adopted in a wide array of fields as a useful tool for modeling phenomena. In statistics, it was observed that the logistic function has a similar S-shape (or sigmoid) to a cumulative normal distribution of probability, as depicted in Figure 5.21, where the \\(x\\) scale represents standard deviations around a mean. As we will learn, the logistic function gives rise to a mathematical model where the coefficients are easily interpreted in terms of likelihood of the outcome. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the logistic model soon became a common approach to modeling probabilistic phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: The logistic function (blue dashed line) is very similar to a cumulative normal distribution (red solid line) but easier to interpret\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Use cases for binomial logistic regression\nBinomial logistic regression can be used when the outcome of interest is binary or dichotomous in nature. That is, it takes one of two values. For example, one or zero, true or false, yes or no. These classes are commonly described as ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ classes. There is an underlying assumption that the cumulative probability of the outcome takes a shape similar to a cumulative normal distribution.\nHere are some example questions that could be approached using binomial logistic regression:\n\nGiven a set of data about sales managers in an organization, including performance against targets, team size, tenure in the organization and other factors, what influence do these factors have on the likelihood of the individual receiving a high performance rating?\nGiven a set of demographic, income and location data, what influence does each have on the likelihood of an individual voting in an election?\nGiven a set of statistics about the in-game activity of soccer players, what relationship does each statistic have with the likelihood of a player scoring a goal?\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst for a large company consisting of regional sales teams across the country. Twice every year, this company promotes some of its salespeople. Promotion is at the discretion of the head of each regional sales team, taking into consideration financial performance, customer satisfaction ratings, recent performance ratings and personal judgment.\nYou are asked by the management of the company to conduct an analysis to determine how the factors of financial performance, customer ratings and performance ratings influence the likelihood of a given salesperson being promoted. You are provided with a data set containing data for the last three years of salespeople considered for promotion. The salespeople data set contains the following fields:\n\npromoted: A binary value indicating 1 if the individual was promoted and 0 if not\nsales: the sales (in thousands of dollars) attributed to the individual in the period of the promotion\ncustomer_rate: the average satisfaction rating from a survey of the individual’s customers during the promotion period\nperformance: the most recent performance rating prior to promotion, from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest)\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the data.\n\n# if needed, download salespeople data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/salespeople.csv\"\nsalespeople &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# look at the first few rows of data\nhead(salespeople)\n\n  promoted sales customer_rate performance\n1        0   594          3.94           2\n2        0   446          4.06           3\n3        1   674          3.83           4\n4        0   525          3.62           2\n5        1   657          4.40           3\n6        1   918          4.54           2\n\n\nThe data looks as expected. Let’s get a summary of the data.\n\nsummary(salespeople)\n\n    promoted          sales       customer_rate    performance \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :151.0   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:389.2   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :0.0000   Median :475.0   Median :3.620   Median :3.0  \n Mean   :0.3219   Mean   :527.0   Mean   :3.608   Mean   :2.5  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:667.2   3rd Qu.:4.290   3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :945.0   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :4.0  \n                  NA's   :1       NA's   :1       NA's   :1    \n\n\nFirst we see a small number of missing values, and we should remove those observations. We see that about a third of individuals were promoted, that sales ranged from $151k to $945k, that as expected the average satisfaction ratings range from 1 to 5, and finally we see four performance ratings, although the performance categories are numeric when they should be an ordered factor, and promoted is numeric when it should be categorical. Let’s convert these, and then let’s do a pairplot to get a quick view on some possible underlying relationships, as in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# remove NAs\nsalespeople &lt;- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople), ]\n\n# convert performance to ordered factor and promoted to categorical\nsalespeople$performance &lt;- ordered(salespeople$performance, \n                                   levels = 1:4)\nsalespeople$promoted &lt;- as.factor(salespeople$promoted)\n\n# generate pairplot\nGGally::ggpairs(salespeople)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Pairplot for the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nWe can see from this pairplot that there are clearly higher sales for those who are promoted versus those who are not. We also see a moderate relationship between customer rating and sales, which is intuitive (if the customer doesn’t think much of you, sales wouldn’t likely be very high).\nSo we can see that some relationships with our outcome may exist here, but it’s not clear how to tease them out and quantify them relative to each other. Let’s explore how binomial logistic regression can help us do this.",

    "text": "5.2 Modeling probabilistic outcomes using a logistic function\nImagine that you have an outcome event \\(y\\) which either occurs or does not occur. The probability of \\(y\\) occurring, or \\(P(y = 1)\\), obviously takes a value between 0 and 1. Now imagine that some input variable \\(x\\) has a positive effect on the probability of the event occurring. Then you would naturally expect \\(P(y = 1)\\) to increase as \\(x\\) increases.\nIn our salespeople data set, let’s plot our promotion outcome against the sales input. This can be seen in Figure 5.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Plot of promotion against sales in the salespeople data set\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that promotion is more likely with higher sales levels. As we move along the \\(x\\) axis from left to right and gradually include more and more individuals with higher sales, we know that the probability of promotion is gradually increasing overall. We could try to model this probability using our logistic function, which we learned about in Section 5.1.1. For example, let’s plot the logistic function \\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_{0})}}\n\\]\non this data, where we set \\(x_0\\) to the mean of sales and \\(k\\) to be some maximum gradient value. In Figure 5.5 we can see these logistic functions for different values of \\(k\\). All of these seem to reflect the pattern we are observing to some extent, but how do we determine the best-fitting logistic function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Overlaying logistic functions with various gradients onto previous plot\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Deriving the concept of log odds\nLet’s look more carefully at the index of the exponential constant \\(e\\) in the denominator of our logistic function. Note that, because \\(x_{0}\\) is a constant, we have:\n\\[\n-k(x - x_{0}) = -(-kx_{0} + kx) = -(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_1x)\n\\] where \\(\\beta_0 = -kx_0\\) and \\(\\beta_{1} = k\\). Therefore,\n\\[\nP(y = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\]\nThis equation makes intuitive sense. As the value of \\(x\\) increases, the value \\(e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}\\) gets smaller and smaller towards zero, and thus \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches its theoretical maximum value of 1. As the value of \\(x\\) decreases towards zero, we see that the value of \\(P(y = 1)\\) approaches a minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\beta_0}}\\). Referring back to our salespeople example, we can thus see that \\(\\beta_0\\) helps determine the baseline probability of promotion assuming no sales at all. If \\(\\beta_0\\) has an extremely negative value, this baseline probability will approach its theoretical minimum of zero.\nLet’s formalize the role of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in the likelihood of a positive outcome. We know that for any binary event \\(y\\), \\(P(y = 0)\\) is equal to \\(1 - P(y = 1)\\), so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(y = 0) &= 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)} - 1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPutting these together, we find that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}}{\\frac{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)}} \\\\\n&= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nor alternatively, if we apply the natural logarithm to both sides\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\n\\]\nThe right-hand side should look familiar from the previous chapter on linear regression, meaning there is something here we can model linearly. But what is the left-hand side?\n\\(P(y = 1)\\) is the probability that the event will occur, while \\(P(y = 0)\\) is the probability that the event will not occur. You may be familiar from sports like horse racing or other gambling situations that the ratio of these two represents the odds of an event. For example, if a given horse has odds of 1:4, this means that there is a 20% probability they will win and an 80% probability they will not2.\nTherefore we can conclude that the natural logarithm of the odds of \\(y\\)—usually termed the log odds of \\(y\\)—is linear in \\(x\\), and therefore we can model the log odds of \\(y\\) using similar linear regression methods to those studied in Chapter 43.\n\n\n5.2.2 Modeling the log odds and interpreting the coefficients\nLet’s take our simple case of regressing the promoted outcome against sales. We use a standard binomial GLM function and our standard formula notation which we learned in the previous chapter.\n\n# run a binomial model \nsales_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales, \n                   data = salespeople, family = \"binomial\")\n\n# view the coefficients\nsales_model$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n-21.77642020   0.03675848 \n\n\nWe can interpret the coefficients as follows:\n\nThe (Intercept) coefficient is the value of the log odds with zero input value of \\(x\\)—it is the log odds of promotion if you made no sales.\nThe sales coefficient represents the increase in the log odds of promotion associated with each unit increase in sales.\n\nWe can convert these coefficients from log odds to odds by applying the exponent function, to return to the identity we had previously\n\\[\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y = 0)} = e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x} = e^{\\beta_0}(e^{\\beta_1})^x\n\\]\nFrom this, we can interpret that \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the base odds of promotion assuming no sales, and that for every additional unit sales, those base odds are multiplied by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). Given this multiplicative effect that \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) has on the odds, it is known as an odds ratio.\n\n# convert log odds to base odds and odds ratio\nexp(sales_model$coefficients)\n\n (Intercept)        sales \n3.488357e-10 1.037442e+00 \n\n\nSo we can see that the base odds of promotion with zero sales is very close to zero, which makes sense. Note that odds can only be precisely zero in a situation where it is impossible to be in the positive class (that is, nobody gets promoted). We can also see that each unit (that is, every $1000) of sales multiplies the base odds by approximately 1.04—in other words, it increases the odds of promotion by 4%.\n\n\n5.2.3 Odds versus probability\nIt is worth spending a little time understanding the concept of odds and how it relates to probability. It is extremely common for these two terms to be used synonymously, and this can lead to serious misunderstandings when interpreting a logistic regression model.\nIf a certain event has a probability of 0.1, then this means that its odds are 1:9, or 0.111. If the probability is 0.5, then the odds are 1, if the probability is 0.9, then the odds are 9, and if the probability is 0.99, the odds are 99. As we approach a probability of 1, the odds become exponentially large, as illustrated in Figure 5.6):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Odds plotted against probability\n\n\n\nThe consequence of this is that a given increase in odds can have a different effect on probability depending on what the original probability was in the first place. If the probability was already quite low, for example 0.1, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 0.116, which translates to a new probability of 0.103586, representing an increase in probability of 3.59%, which is very close to the increase in odds. If the probability was already high, say 0.9, then a 4% increase in odds translates to odds of 9.36, which translates to a new probability of 0.903475 representing an increase in probability of 0.39%, which is very different from the increase in odds. Figure 5.7 shows the impact of a 4% increase in odds according to the original probability of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Effect of 4% increase in odds plotted against original probability\n\n\n\nWe can see that the closer the base probability is to zero, the similar the effect of the increase on both odds and on probability. However, the higher the probability of the event, the less impact the increase in odds has. In any case, it’s useful to remember the formulas for converting odds to probability and vice versa. If \\(O\\) represents odds and \\(P\\) represents probability then we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nO &= \\frac{P}{1 - P} \\\\\nP &= \\frac{O}{1 + O}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

This is because everyone is in one of the four performance categories, so the model is using performance_1 as the reference case. We can interpret each performance coefficient as the effect of a move to that performance category from performance_1.\nWe can already see from the last column of our coefficient summary—the coefficient p-values—that only sales and customer_rate meet the significance threshold of less than 0.05. Interestingly, it appears from the Estimate column that customer_rate has a negative effect on the log odds of promotion. For convenience, we can add an extra column to our coefficient summary to create the exponents of our estimated coefficients so that we can see the odds ratios. We can also remove columns that are less useful to us if we wish.\n\n# create coefficient table with estimates, p-values and odds ratios\n(full_coefs &lt;- cbind(coefs[ ,c(\"Estimate\", \"Pr(&gt;|z|)\")], \n                     odds_ratio = exp(full_model$coefficients))) \n\n                  Estimate     Pr(&gt;|z|)   odds_ratio\n(Intercept)   -19.85893195 8.112287e-09 2.373425e-09\nsales           0.04012425 1.052611e-09 1.040940e+00\ncustomer_rate  -1.11213130 2.121881e-02 3.288573e-01\nperformance_2   0.26299953 7.969139e-01 1.300826e+00\nperformance_3   0.68495453 4.855581e-01 1.983682e+00\nperformance_4   0.73449340 4.932272e-01 2.084426e+00\n\n\nNow we can interpret our model as follows:\n\nAll else being equal, sales have a significant positive effect on the likelihood of promotion, with each additional thousand dollars of sales increasing the odds of promotion by 4%\nAll else being equal, customer ratings have a significant negative effect on the likelihood of promotion, with one full rating higher associated with 67% lower odds of promotion\nAll else being equal, performance ratings have no significant effect on the likelihood of promotion\n\nThe second conclusion may appear counter-intuitive, but remember from our pairplot in Section 5.1.3 that there is already moderate correlation between sales and customer ratings, and this model will be controlling for that relationship. Recall that our odds ratios act assuming all other variables are the same. Therefore, if two individuals have the same sales and performance ratings, the one with the lower customer rating is more likely to have been promoted. Similarly, if two individuals have the same level of sales and the same customer rating, their performance rating will have no significant bearing on the likelihood of promotion.\nMany analysts will feel uncomfortable with stating these conclusions with too much precision, and therefore exponent confidence intervals can be calculated to provide a range for the odds ratios.\n\nexp(confint(full_model))\n\n                     2.5 %       97.5 %\n(Intercept)   7.879943e-13 7.385387e-07\nsales         1.029762e+00 1.057214e+00\ncustomer_rate 1.141645e-01 7.793018e-01\nperformance_2 1.800447e-01 1.061602e+01\nperformance_3 3.060299e-01 1.547188e+01\nperformance_4 2.614852e-01 1.870827e+01\n\n\nTherefore we can say that—all else being equal—every additional unit of sales increases the odds of promotion by between 3.0% and 5.7%, and every additional point in customer rating decreases the odds of promotion by between 22% and 89%.\nSimilar to other regression models, the unit scale needs to be taken into consideration during interpretation. On first sight, a decrease of up to 89% in odds seems a lot more important than an increase of up to 5.7% in odds. However, the increase of up to 5.7% is for one unit ($1000) in many thousands of sales units, and over 10 or 100 additional units can have a substantial compound effect on odds of promotion. The decrease of up to 89% is on a full customer rating point on a scale of only 4 full points.\n\n\n5.3.2 Understanding the fit and goodness-of-fit of a binomial logistic regression model\nUnderstanding the fit of a binomial logistic regression model is not straightforward and is sometimes controversial. Before we discuss this, let’s simplify our model based on our learning that the performance data has no significant effect on the outcome.\n\n# simplify model\nsimpler_model &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate,\n                     family = \"binomial\",\n                     data = salespeople)\n\nAs in the previous chapter, again we have the luxury of a three-dimensional model, so we can visualize it in Interactive Figure 5.9, revealing a 3D sigmoid curve which ‘twists’ to reflect the relative influence of sales and customer_rate on the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: 3D visualization of the fitted simpler_model against the salespeople data\n\n\nNow let’s look at the summary of our simpler_model.\n\nsummary(simpler_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = promoted ~ sales + customer_rate, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = salespeople)\n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

The main reason for this is that there is no clear unified point of view in the statistics community on a single appropriate measure for model fit in the case of logistic regression. Nevertheless, a number of options are available to analysts for estimating fit and goodness-of-fit for these models.\nPseudo-\\(R^2\\) measures are attempts to estimate the amount of variance in the outcome that is explained by the fitted model, analogous to the \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. There are numerous variants of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) with some of the most common listed here:\n\nMcFadden’s \\(R^2\\) works by comparing the likelihood function of the fitted model with that of a random model and using this to estimate the explained variance in the outcome.\nCox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) works by applying a ‘sum of squares’ analogy to the likelihood functions to align more closely with the precise methodology for calculating \\(R^2\\) in linear regression. However, this usually means that the maximum value is less than 1 and in certain circumstances substantially less than 1, which can be problematic and unintuitive for an \\(R^2\\).\nNagelkerke’s \\(R^2\\) resolves the issue with the upper bound for Cox and Snell by dividing Cox and Snell’s \\(R^2\\) by its upper bound. This restores an intuitive scale with a maximum of 1, but is considered somewhat arbitrary with limited theoretical foundation.\nTjur’s \\(R^2\\) is a more recent and simpler concept. It is defined as simply the absolute difference between the predicted probabilities of the positive observations and those of the negative observations.\n\nStandard modeling functions generally do not offer the calculation of pseudo-\\(R^2\\) as standard, but numerous methods are available for their calculation. For example:\n\nlibrary(DescTools)\nDescTools::PseudoR2(\n  simpler_model, \n  which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\", \"Tjur\")\n)\n\n  McFadden   CoxSnell Nagelkerke       Tjur \n 0.8520759  0.6576490  0.9187858  0.8784834 \n\n\nWe see that the Cox and Snell variant is notably lower than the other estimates, which is consistent with the known issues with its upper bound. However, the other estimates are reasonably aligned and suggest a strong fit.\nGoodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models compare the predictions to the observed outcome and test the null hypothesis that they are similar. This means that, unlike in linear regression, a low p-value indicates a poor fit. One commonly used method is the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which divides the observations into a number of groups (usually 10) according to their fitted probabilities, calculates the proportion of each group that is positive and then compares this to the expected proportions based on the model prediction using a Chi-squared test. However, this method has limitations. It is particularly problematic for situations where there is a low sample size and can return highly varied results based on the number of groups used. It is therefore recommended to use a range of goodness-of-fit tests, and not rely entirely on any one specific approach.\nIn R, the generalhoslem package can perform the popular Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness of fit for logistic regression models, and is recommended for exploration. Here is an example using the logitgof() function for assessing goodness-of-fit, which uses 10 groups as default.\n\nlibrary(generalhoslem)\n\n# run Hosmer-Lemeshow GOF test on observed versus fitted values\nsimpler_model_diagnostics &lt;- generalhoslem::logitgof(\n  salespeople$promoted, \n  fitted(simpler_model) \n)\n\n# view results\nsimpler_model_diagnostics\n\n\n    Hosmer and Lemeshow test (binary model)\n\ndata:  salespeople$promoted, fitted(simpler_model)\nX-squared = 3.4458, df = 8, p-value = 0.9034\n\n\nThe non-significant result of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests a good fit for our model.\nVarious measures of predictive accuracy can also be used to assess a binomial logistic regression model in a predictive context, such as precision, recall and ROC-curve analysis. These are particularly suited for implementations of logistic regression models as predictive classifiers in a Machine Learning context, a topic which is outside the scope of this book. However, a recommended source for a deeper treatment of goodness-of-fit tests for logistic regression models is Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013).\n\n\n5.3.3 Model parsimony\nWe saw that in both our linear regression and our logistic regression approach, we decided to drop variables from our model when we determined that they had no significant effect on the outcome. The principle of Occam’s Razor states that—all else being equal—the simplest explanation is the best. In this sense, a model that contains information that does not contribute to its primary inference objective is more complex than it needs to be. Such a model increases the communication burden in explaining its results to others, with no notable analytic benefit in return.\nParsimony describes the concept of being careful with resources or with information. A model could be described as more parsimonious if it can achieve the same (or very close to the same) fit with a smaller number of inputs. The Akaike Information Criterion or AIC is a measure of model parsimony that is computed for log-likelihood models like logistic regression models, with a lower AIC indicating a more parsimonious model. AIC is often calculated as standard in summary reports of logistic regression models but can also be calculated independently. Let’s compare the different iterations of our model in this chapter using AIC.\n\n# sales only model\nAIC(sales_model)\n\n[1] 76.49508\n\n# sales and customer rating model\nAIC(simpler_model)\n\n[1] 71.13145\n\n# model with all inputs\nAIC(full_model)\n\n[1] 76.37433\n\n\nWe can see that the model which is limited to our two significant inputs—sales and customer rating—is determined to be the most parsimonious model according to the AIC. Note that the AIC should not be used to interpret model quality or confidence—it is possible that the lowest AIC might still be a very poor fit.\nModel parsimony becomes a substantial concern when there is a large number of input variables. As a general rule, the more input variables there are in a model the greater the chance that the model will be difficult to interpret clearly, and the greater the risk of measurement problems, such as multicollinearity. Analysts who are eager to please their customers, clients, professors or bosses can easily be tempted to think up new potential inputs to their model, often derived mathematically from measures that are already inputs in the model. Before long the model is too complex, and in extreme cases there are more inputs than there are observations. The primary way to manage model complexity is to exercise caution in selecting model inputs. When large numbers of inputs are unavoidable, coefficient regularization methods such as LASSO regression can help with model parsimony.",

    "text": "5.4 Other considerations in binomial logistic regression\nTo predict from new data, just use the predict() function as in the previous chapter. This function recognizes the type of model being used—in this case a generalized linear model—and adjusts its prediction approach accordingly. In particular, if you want to return the probability of the new observations being promoted, you need to use type = \"response\" as an argument.\n\n# define new observations\n(new_data &lt;- data.frame(sales = c(420, 510, 710), \n                        customer_rate = c(3.4, 2.3, 4.2)))\n\n  sales customer_rate\n1   420           3.4\n2   510           2.3\n3   710           4.2\n\n# predict probability of promotion\npredict(simpler_model, new_data, type = \"response\")\n\n         1          2          3 \n0.00171007 0.18238565 0.98840506 \n\n\nMany of the principles covered in the previous chapter on linear regression are equally important in logistic regression. For example, input variables should be managed in a similar way. Collinearity and multicollinearity should be of concern. Interaction of input variables can be modeled. For the most part, analysts should be aware of the fundamental mathematical transformations which take place in a logistic regression model when they consider some of these issues (another reason to ensure that the mathematics covered earlier in this chapter is well understood). For example, while coefficients in linear regression have a direct additive impact on \\(y\\), in logistic regression they have a direct additive impact on the log odds of \\(y\\), or alternatively their exponents have a direct multiplicative impact on the odds of \\(y\\). Therefore coefficient overestimation such as that which can occur when collinearity is not managed can result in inferences that could substantially overstate the importance or effect of input variables.\nBecause of the binary nature of our outcome variable, the residuals of a logistic regression model have limited direct application to the problem being studied. In practical contexts the residuals of logistic regression models are rarely examined, but they can be useful in identifying outliers or particularly influential observations and in assessing goodness-of-fit. When residuals are examined, they need to be transformed in order to be analyzed appropriately. For example, the Pearson residual is a standardized form of residual from logistic regression which can be expected to have a normal distribution over large-enough samples. We can see in Figure 5.10 that this is the case for our simpler_model, but that there are a small number of substantial underestimates in our model. A good source of further learning on diagnostics of logistic regression models is Menard (2010).\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- density(residuals(simpler_model, \"pearson\"))\nplot(d, main= \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Distribution of Pearson residuals in simpler_model",

    "text": "6.1.1 Intuition for multinomial logistic regression\nA binary or dichotomous outcome like we studied in the previous chapter is already in fact a nominal outcome with two categories, so in principle we already have the basic technology with which to study this problem. That said, the way we approach the problem can differ according to the types of inferences we wish to make.\nIf we only wish to make inferences about the choice of each specific category—what drives whether an observation is in Category A versus the others, or Category B versus the others—then we have the option of running separate binomial logistic regression models on a ‘one versus the rest’ basis. In this case we can refine our model differently for each category, eliminating variables that are not significant in determining membership of that category. This could potentially lead to models being defined differently for different target outcome categories. Notably, there will be no common comparison category between these models. This is sometimes called a stratified approach.\nHowever, in many studies there is a need for a ‘reference’ category to better understand the relative odds of category membership. For example, in clinical settings the relative risk factors for different clinical outcomes can only be understood relative to a reference (usually that of the ‘most healthy’ or ‘most recovered’ patients)1. In organizational settings, one can imagine that the odds of different types of mid-tenure career path changes could only be well understood relative to a reference career path (probably the most common one). While this approach would still be founded on binomial models, the reference points of these models are different; we would need to make decisions on refining the model differently, and we interpret the coefficients in a different way.\nIn this chapter we will briefly look at the stratified approach (which is effectively a repetition of work done in the previous chapter) before focusing more intently on how we construct models and make inferences using a multinomial approach.\n\n\n6.1.2 Use cases for multinomial logistic regression\nMultinomial logistic regression is appropriate for any situation where a limited number of outcome categories (more than two) are being modeled and where those outcome categories have no order. An underlying assumption is the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Otherwise stated, this assumption means that there is no other alternative for the outcome that, if included, would disproportionately influence the membership of one of the other categories2. In cases where this assumption is violated, one could choose to take a stratified approach, or attempt hierarchical or nested multinomial model alternatives, which are beyond the scope of this book.\nExamples of typical situations that might be modeled by multinomial logistic regression include:\n\nModeling voting choice in elections with multiple candidates\nModeling choice of career options by students\nModeling choice of benefit options by employees\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst at a large technology company. The company recently introduced a new health insurance provider for its employees. At the beginning of the year the employees had to choose one of three different health plan products from this provider to best suit their needs. You have been asked to determine which factors influenced the choice in product.\nThe health_insurance data set consists of the following fields:\n\nproduct: The choice of product of the individual—A, B or C\nage: The age of the individual when they made the choice\ngender: The gender of the individual as stated when they made the choice\nhousehold: The number of people living with the individual in the same household at the time of the choice\nposition_level: Position level in the company at the time they made the choice, where 1 is is the lowest and 5 is the highest\nabsent: The number of days the individual was absent from work in the year prior to the choice\n\nFirst we load the data and take a look at it briefly.\n\n# if needed, download health_insurance data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/health_insurance.csv\"\nhealth_insurance &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\n# view first few rows\nhead(health_insurance)\n\n  product age household position_level gender absent\n1       C  57         2              2   Male     10\n2       A  21         7              2   Male      7\n3       C  66         7              2   Male      1\n4       A  36         4              2 Female      6\n5       A  23         0              2   Male     11\n6       A  31         5              1   Male     14\n\n\n\n# view structure\nstr(health_insurance)\n\n'data.frame':   1453 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ product       : chr  \"C\" \"A\" \"C\" \"A\" ...\n $ age           : int  57 21 66 36 23 31 37 37 55 66 ...\n $ household     : int  2 7 7 4 0 5 3 0 3 2 ...\n $ position_level: int  2 2 2 2 2 1 3 3 3 4 ...\n $ gender        : chr  \"Male\" \"Male\" \"Male\" \"Female\" ...\n $ absent        : int  10 7 1 6 11 14 12 25 3 18 ...\n\n\nIt looks like two of these columns should be converted to factor—product and gender—so let’s do that and then run a pairplot for a quick overview of any patterns, which can be seen in Figure 6.1.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# convert product and gender to factors\nhealth_insurance$product &lt;- as.factor(health_insurance$product)\nhealth_insurance$gender &lt;- as.factor(health_insurance$gender)\n\nGGally::ggpairs(health_insurance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Pairplot of the health_insurance data set\n\n\n\nThe data appears somewhat chaotic here. However, there are a few things to note. Firstly, we notice that there is a relatively even spread in choice between the products. We also notice that age seems to be playing a role in product choice. There are also some mild-to-moderate correlations in the data—in particular between age and position_level, and between absent and position_level. However, this problem is clearly more complex than we can determine from a bivariate perspective.",

    "text": "6.2 Running stratified binomial models\nOne approach to this problem is to look at each product choice and treat it as an independent binomial logistic regression model, modeling that choice against an alternative of all other choices. Each such model may help us describe the dynamics of the choice of a specific product, but we have to be careful in making conclusions about the overall choice between the three products. Running stratified models would not be very efficient if we had a wider range of choices for our outcome, but since we only have three possible choices here, it is reasonable to take this route.\n\n6.2.1 Modeling the choice of Product A versus other products\nLet’s first create and refine a binomial model for the choice of Product A.\n\nlibrary(makedummies)\n\n# create dummies for product choice outcome\ndummy_product &lt;- makedummies::makedummies(health_insurance, \n                                          col = \"product\",\n                                          basal_level = TRUE)\n\n# combine to original set\nhealth_insurance &lt;- cbind(health_insurance, dummy_product)\n\n# run a binomial model for the Product A dummy against \n# all input variables (let glm() handle dummy input variables)\nA_model &lt;- glm(\n  formula = product_A ~ age + gender + household + \n    position_level + absent, \n  data = health_insurance, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n\n# summary\nsummary(A_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = product_A ~ age + gender + household + position_level + \n    absent, family = \"binomial\", data = health_insurance)\n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

All else being equal, being older makes the choice of Product A less likely. Males are more likely to choose Product A, and larger households and higher position levels also make the choice of Product A more likely. Based on this, we can consider simplifying our model to remove absent. We can also calculate odds ratios and perform some model diagnostics if we wish, similar to how we approached the problem in the previous chapter.\nThese results need to be interpreted carefully. For example, the odds ratios for the Product A choice based on a simplified model are as follows:\n\n# simpler model\nA_simple &lt;- glm(\n  formula = product_A ~ age + household + gender + position_level, \n  data = health_insurance,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# view odds ratio as a data frame\nas.data.frame(exp(A_simple$coefficients))\n\n                 exp(A_simple$coefficients)\n(Intercept)                     343.4406669\nage                               0.7868098\nhousehold                         1.2711317\ngenderMale                        2.3282637\ngenderNon-binary                  1.2794288\nposition_level                    1.3692971\n\n\nAs an example, and as a reminder from our previous chapter, we interpret the odds ratio for age as follows: all else being equal, every additional year of age is associated with an approximately 21% decrease in the odds of choosing Product A over the other products.\n\n\n6.2.2 Modeling other choices\nIn a similar way we can produce two other models, representing the choice of Products B and C. These models produce similar significant variables, except that position_level does not appear to be significant in the choice of Product C. If we simplify all our three models we will have a slightly differently defined model for the choice of Product C versus our models for the other two product choices. However, we can conclude in general that the only input variable that seems to be non-significant across all choices of product is absent.",

    "text": "6.3 Running a multinomial regression model\nAn alternative to running separate binary stratified models is to run a multinomial logistic regression model. A multinomial logistic model will base itself from a defined reference category, and run a generalized linear model on the log-odds of membership of each of the other categories versus the reference category. Due to its extensive use in epidemiology and medicine, this is often known as the relative risk of one category compared to the reference category. Mathematically speaking, if \\(X\\) is the vector of input variables, and \\(y\\) takes the value \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(C\\), with \\(A\\) as the reference, a multinomial logistic regression model will calculate:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = B)}{P(y=A)}\\right) = \\alpha{X}\n\\] and\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=A)}\\right) = \\beta{X}\n\\] for different vectors of coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\n6.3.1 Defining a reference level and running the model\nThe nnet package in R contains a multinom() function for running a multinomial logistic regression model using neural network technology3. Before we can run the model we need to make sure our reference level is defined.\n\n# define reference by ensuring it is the first level of the factor\nhealth_insurance$product &lt;- relevel(health_insurance$product, ref = \"A\")\n\n# check that A is now our reference\nlevels(health_insurance$product)\n\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\"\n\n\nOnce the reference outcome is defined, the multinom() function from the nnet package will run a series of binomial models comparing the reference to each of the other categories.\nFirst we will calculate our multinomial logistic regression model.\n\nlibrary(nnet)\n\nmulti_model &lt;- multinom(\n  formula = product ~ age + gender + household + \n    position_level + absent, \n  data = health_insurance\n)\n\nNow we will look at a summary of the results.\n\nsummary(multi_model)\n\nCall:\nmultinom(formula = product ~ age + gender + household + position_level + \n    absent, data = health_insurance)\n\nCoefficients:\n  (Intercept)       age  genderMale genderNon-binary  household position_level\nB    -4.60100 0.2436645 -2.38259765        0.2523409 -0.9677237     -0.4153040\nC   -10.22617 0.2698141  0.09670752       -1.2715643  0.2043568     -0.2135843\n       absent\nB 0.011676034\nC 0.003263631\n\nStd.

For example, what are the odds ratios of Product C relative to a reference of Product B? One way to do this would be to change the reference and run the model again. Another option is to note that:\n\\[\n\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=B)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y = A)}}{\\frac{P(y=B)}{P(y = A)}}\n= \\frac{e^{\\beta{X}}}{e^{\\alpha{X}}}\n= e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)X}\n\\] Therefore\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = C)}{P(y=B)}\\right) = (\\beta - \\alpha)X\n\\] This means we can obtain the coefficients of C against the reference of B by simply calculating the difference between the coefficients of C and B against the common reference of A.

However, to determine standard errors and p-values for these coefficients the model will need to be recalculated against the new reference.",

    "text": "6.4 Model simplification, fit and goodness-of-fit for multinomial logistic regression models\nSimplifying a multinomial regression model needs to be done with care. In a binomial model, there is one set of coefficients and their p-values can be a strong guide to which variables can be removed safely. However, in multinomial models there are several sets of coefficients to consider.\n\n6.4.1 Gradual safe elimination of variables\nIn Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013), a gradual process of elimination of variables is recommended to ensure that significant variables that confound each other in the different logistic models are not accidentally dropped from the final model. The recommended approach is as follows:\n\nStart with the variable with the least significant p-values in all sets of coefficients—in our case absent would be the obvious first candidate.\nRun the multinomial model without this variable.\nTest that none of the previous coefficients change by more than 20–25%.\nIf there was no such change, safely remove the variable and proceed to the next non-significant variable.\nIf there is such a change, retain the variable and proceed to the next non-significant variable.\nStop when all non-significant variables have been tested.\n\nIn our case, we can compare the coefficients of the model with and without absent included and verify that the changes in the coefficients are not substantial.\n\n# remove absent\nsimpler_multi_model &lt;- multinom(\n  formula = product ~ age + gender + household + position_level,\n  data = health_insurance, \n  model = TRUE\n)\n\n\n# view coefficients with absent\ndata.frame(t(summary(multi_model)$coefficients))\n\n                           B             C\n(Intercept)      -4.60099991 -10.226169428\nage               0.24366447   0.269814063\ngenderMale       -2.38259765   0.096707521\ngenderNon-binary  0.25234087  -1.271564323\nhousehold        -0.96772368   0.204356774\nposition_level   -0.41530400  -0.213584308\nabsent            0.01167603   0.003263631\n\n\n\n# view coefficients without absent\ndata.frame(t(summary(simpler_multi_model)$coefficients))\n\n                          B            C\n(Intercept)      -4.5008999 -10.19269011\nage               0.2433855   0.26976294\ngenderMale       -2.3771342   0.09801281\ngenderNon-binary  0.1712091  -1.29636779\nhousehold        -0.9641956   0.20510806\nposition_level   -0.3912014  -0.20908835\n\n\nWe can see that only genderNon-binary changed substantially, but we note that this is on an extremely small sample size and so will not have any effect on our model4. It therefore appears safe to remove absent. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion is equally valid in multinomial models for evaluating model parsimony. Here we can calculate that the AIC of our model with and without absent is 1517.36 and 1514.25, respectively, confirming that the model without absent is marginally more parsimonious.\n\n\n6.4.2 Model fit and goodness-of-fit\nAs with the binomial case, a variety of Pseudo-\\(R^2\\) methods are available to assess the fit of a multinomial logistic regression model, although some of our previous variants (particularly Tjur) are not defined on models with more than two outcome categories.\n\nDescTools::PseudoR2(simpler_multi_model, \n                    which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\"))\n\n  McFadden   CoxSnell Nagelkerke \n 0.5329175  0.6896945  0.7760413 \n\n\nDue to the fact that multinomial models have more than one set of coefficients, assessing goodness-of-fit is more challenging, and is still an area of intense research. The most approachable method to assess model confidence is the Hosmer-Lemeshow test mentioned in the previous chapter, which was extended in Fagerland, Hosmer, and Bofin (2008) for multinomial models. An implementation is available in the generalhoslem package in R. However, this version of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test is problematic for models with a small number of input variables (fewer than ten), and therefore we will not experiment with it here. For further exploration of this topic, Chapter 8 of Hosmer, Lemeshow, and Sturdivant (2013) is recommended, and for a more thorough treatment of the entire topic of categorical analytics, Agresti (2007) is an excellent companion.",

    "text": "7.1 When to use it\nOften our outcomes will be categorical in nature, but they will also have an order to them. These are sometimes known as ordinal outcomes. Some very common examples of this include ratings of some form, such as job performance ratings or survey responses on Likert scales. The appropriate modeling approach for these outcome types is ordinal logistic regression. Surprisingly, this approach is frequently not understood or adopted by analysts. Often they treat the outcome as a continuous variable and perform simple linear regression, which can lead to wildly inaccurate inferences. Given the prevalence of ordinal outcomes in people analytics, it would serve analysts well to know how to run ordinal logistic regression models, how to interpret them and how to confirm their validity.\nIn fact, there are numerous known ways to approach the inferential modeling of ordinal outcomes, all of which build on the theory of linear, binomial and multinomial regression which we covered in previous chapters. In this chapter, we will focus on the most commonly adopted approach: proportional odds logistic regression. Proportional odds models (sometimes known as constrained cumulative logistic models) are more attractive than other approaches because of their ease of interpretation but cannot be used blindly without important checking of underlying assumptions.",

In common with linear regression, we can consider our outcome to increase or decrease dependent on our inputs. However, unlike linear regression the increase and decrease is ‘stepwise’ rather than continuous, and we do not know that the difference between the steps is the same across the scale. In medical settings, the difference between moving from healthy to an early-stage disease may not be equivalent to moving from an early-stage disease to an intermediate- or advanced-stage. Equally, it may be a much bigger psychological step for a performance evaluator to give someone a low performance rating than to give them a high performance rating. In this sense, we are analyzing categorical outcomes similar to a multinomial approach.\nTo formalize this intuition, we can imagine a latent version of our outcome variable that takes a continuous form, and where the categories are formed at specific cutoff points on that continuous variable. For example, if our outcome variable \\(y\\) represents job performance on an ordinal scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), we can imagine we are actually dealing with a continuous variable \\(y'\\) along with four increasing ‘cutoff points’ for \\(y'\\) at \\(\\tau_1\\), \\(\\tau_2\\), \\(\\tau_3\\) and \\(\\tau_4\\). We then define each ordinal category as follows: \\(y = 1\\) corresponds to \\(y' \\le \\tau_1\\), \\(y \\le 2\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_2\\), \\(y \\le 3\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_3\\) and \\(y \\le 4\\) to \\(y' \\le \\tau_4\\). Further, at each such cutoff \\(\\tau_k\\), we assume that the probability \\(P(y' &gt; \\tau_k)\\) takes the form of a logistic function. Therefore, in the proportional odds model, we ‘divide’ the probability space at each level of the outcome variable and consider each as a binomial logistic regression model. For example, at rating 3, we generate a binomial logistic regression model of \\(P(y' &gt; \\tau_3)\\), as illustrated in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Proportional odds model illustration for a 5-point job performance scale outcome greater than 3 on a single input variable. Each cutoff point in the latent continuous outcome variable gives rise to a binomial logistic function.\n\n\n\nThis approach leads to a highly interpretable model that provides a single set of coefficients that are agnostic to the outcome category. For example, we can say that each unit increase in input variable \\(x\\) increases the odds of \\(y\\) being in a higher category by a certain ratio.\n\n\n7.1.2 Use cases for proportional odds logistic regression\nProportional odds logistic regression can be used when there are more than two outcome categories that have an order. An important underlying assumption is that no input variable has a disproportionate effect on a specific level of the outcome variable. This is known as the proportional odds assumption. Referring to Figure 7.1, this assumption means that the ‘slope’ of the logistic function is the same for all category cutoffs1. If this assumption is violated, we cannot reduce the coefficients of the model to a single set across all outcome categories, and this modeling approach fails. Therefore, testing the proportional odds assumption is an important validation step for anyone running this type of model.\nExamples of problems that can utilize a proportional odds logistic regression approach include:\n\nUnderstanding the factors associated with higher ratings in an employee survey on a Likert scale\nUnderstanding the factors associated with higher job performance ratings on an ordinal performance scale\nUnderstanding the factors associated with voting preference in a ranked preference voting system (for example, proportional representation systems)\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Walkthrough example\nYou are an analyst for a sports broadcaster who is doing a feature on player discipline in professional soccer games. To prepare for the feature, you have been asked to verify whether certain metrics are significant in influencing the extent to which a player will be disciplined by the referee for unfair or dangerous play in a game. You have been provided with data on over 2000 different players in different games, and the data contains these fields:\n\ndiscipline: A record of the maximum discipline taken by the referee against the player in the game. ‘None’ means no discipline was taken, ‘Yellow’ means the player was issued a yellow card (warned), ‘Red’ means the player was issued a red card and ordered off the field of play.\nn_yellow_25 is the total number of yellow cards issued to the player in the previous 25 games they played prior to this game.\nn_red_25 is the total number of red cards issued to the player in the previous 25 games they played prior to this game.\nposition is the playing position of the player in the game: ‘D’ is defense (including goalkeeper), ‘M’ is midfield and ‘S’ is striker/attacker.\nlevel is the skill level of the competition in which the game took place, with 1 being higher and 2 being lower.\ncountry is the country in which the game took place—England or Germany.\nresult is the result of the game for the team of the player—‘W’ is win, ‘L’ is lose, ‘D’ is a draw/tie.\n\nLet’s download the soccer data set and take a quick look at it.\n\n# if needed, download data\nurl &lt;- \"http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/data/soccer.csv\"\nsoccer &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n\nhead(soccer)\n\n  discipline n_yellow_25 n_red_25 position result country level\n1       None           4        1        S      D England     1\n2       None           2        2        D      W England     2\n3       None           2        1        M      D England     1\n4       None           2        1        M      L Germany     1\n5       None           2        0        S      W Germany     1\n6       None           3        2        M      W England     1\n\n\nLet’s also take a look at the structure of the data.\n\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : chr  \"None\" \"None\" \"None\" \"None\" ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : chr  \"S\" \"D\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ result     : chr  \"D\" \"W\" \"D\" \"L\" ...\n $ country    : chr  \"England\" \"England\" \"England\" \"Germany\" ...\n $ level      : int  1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe see that there are numerous fields that need to be converted to factors before we can model them. Firstly, our outcome of interest is discipline and this needs to be an ordered factor, which we can choose to increase with the seriousness of the disciplinary action.\n\n# convert discipline to ordered factor\nsoccer$discipline &lt;- ordered(soccer$discipline, \n                             levels = c(\"None\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\"))\n\n# check conversion\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"None\"&lt;\"Yellow\"&lt;..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : chr  \"S\" \"D\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ result     : chr  \"D\" \"W\" \"D\" \"L\" ...\n $ country    : chr  \"England\" \"England\" \"England\" \"Germany\" ...\n $ level      : int  1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe also know that position, country, result and level are categorical, so we convert them to factors. We could in fact choose to convert result and level into ordered factors if we so wish, but this is not necessary for input variables, and the results are usually a little bit easier to read as nominal factors.\n\n# apply as.factor to four columns\ncats &lt;- c(\"position\", \"country\", \"result\", \"level\")\nsoccer[ ,cats] &lt;- lapply(soccer[ ,cats], as.factor)\n\n# check again\nstr(soccer)\n\n'data.frame':   2291 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ discipline : Ord.factor w/ 3 levels \"None\"&lt;\"Yellow\"&lt;..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ n_yellow_25: int  4 2 2 2 2 3 4 3 4 3 ...\n $ n_red_25   : int  1 2 1 1 0 2 2 0 3 3 ...\n $ position   : Factor w/ 3 levels \"D\",\"M\",\"S\": 3 1 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 1 ...\n $ result     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"D\",\"L\",\"W\": 1 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 1 2 ...\n $ country    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"England\",\"Germany\": 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 ...\n $ level      : Factor w/ 2 levels \"1\",\"2\": 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nNow our data is in a position to run a model. You may wish to conduct some exploratory data analysis at this stage similar to previous chapters, but from this chapter onward we will skip this and focus on the modeling methodology.",

    "text": "7.2 Modeling ordinal outcomes under the assumption of proportional odds\nFor simplicity, and noting that this is easily generalizable, let’s assume that we have an ordinal outcome variable \\(y\\) with three levels similar to our walkthrough example, and that we have one input variable \\(x\\). Let’s call the outcome levels 1, 2 and 3. To follow our intuition from Section 7.1.1, we can model a linear continuous variable \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + E\\), where \\(E\\) is some error with a mean of zero, and two increasing cutoff values \\(\\tau_1\\) and \\(\\tau_2\\). We define \\(y\\) in terms of \\(y'\\) as follows: \\(y = 1\\) if \\(y' \\le \\tau_1\\), \\(y = 2\\) if \\(\\tau_1 &lt; y' \\le \\tau_2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) if \\(y' &gt; \\tau_2\\).\n\n7.2.1 Using a latent continuous outcome variable to derive a proportional odds model\nRecall from Section 4.5.3 that our linear regression approach assumes that our residuals \\(E\\) around our line \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0\\) have a normal distribution. Let’s modify that assumption slightly and instead assume that our residuals take a logistic distribution based on the variance of \\(y'\\). Therefore, \\(y' = \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + \\sigma\\epsilon\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is proportional to the variance of \\(y'\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) follows the shape of a logistic function. That is\n\\[\nP(\\epsilon \\leq z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n\\]\nLet’s look at the probability that our ordinal outcome variable \\(y\\) is in its lowest category.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(y = 1) &= P(y' \\le \\tau_1) \\\\\n&= P(\\alpha_1x + \\alpha_0 + \\sigma\\epsilon \\leq \\tau_1) \\\\\n&= P(\\epsilon \\leq \\frac{\\tau_1 - \\alpha_1x - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}) \\\\\n&= P(\\epsilon \\le \\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1 = \\frac{\\tau_1 - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}\\) and \\(\\beta = \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\sigma}\\).\nSince our only values for \\(y\\) are 1, 2 and 3, similar to our derivations in Section 5.2, we conclude that \\(P(y &gt; 1) = 1 - P(y = 1)\\), which calculates to\n\\[\nP(y &gt; 1) = \\frac{e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}\n\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y &gt; 1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}}{\\frac{e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}{1 + e^{-(\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x})}}}\n= e^{\\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBy applying the natural logarithm, we conclude that the log odds of \\(y\\) being in our bottom category is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y = 1)}{P(y &gt; 1)}\\right) = \\gamma_1 - \\beta{x}\n\\]\nIn a similar way we can derive the log odds of our ordinal outcome being in our bottom two categories as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y \\leq 2)}{P(y = 3)}\\right) = \\gamma_2 - \\beta{x}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\tau_2 - \\alpha_0}{\\sigma}\\). One can easily see how this generalizes to an arbitrary number of ordinal categories, where we can state the log odds of being in category \\(k\\) or lower as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y \\leq k)}{P(y &gt; k)}\\right) = \\gamma_k - \\beta{x}\n\\] Alternatively, we can state the log odds of being in a category higher than \\(k\\) by simply inverting the above expression:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ln}\\left(\\frac{P(y &gt; k)}{P(y \\leq k)}\\right) = -(\\gamma_k - \\beta{x}) = \\beta{x} - \\gamma_k\n\\]\nBy taking exponents we see that the impact of a unit change in \\(x\\) on the odds of \\(y\\) being in a higher ordinal category is \\(\\beta\\), irrespective of what category we are looking at. Therefore we have a single coefficient to explain the effect of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\) throughout the ordinal scale. Note that there are still different intercept coefficients \\(\\gamma_1\\) and \\(\\gamma_2\\) for each level of the ordinal scale.\n\n\n7.2.2 Running a proportional odds logistic regression model\nThe MASS package provides a function polr() for running a proportional odds logistic regression model on a data set in a similar way to our previous models. The key (and obvious) requirement is that the outcome is an ordered factor. Since we did our conversions in Section 7.1.3 we are ready to run this model. We will start by running it on all input variables and let the polr() function handle our dummy variables automatically.\n\n# run proportional odds model\nlibrary(MASS)\nmodel &lt;- polr(\n  formula = discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    country + level + result, \n  data = soccer\n)\n\n# get summary\nsummary(model)\n\nCall:\npolr(formula = discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    country + level + result, data = soccer)\n\nCoefficients:\n                  Value Std.

We also see that there are separate intercepts for the various levels of our outcomes, as we also expect. In interpreting our model, we generally don’t have a great deal of interest in the intercepts, but we will focus on the coefficients. First we would like to obtain p-values, so we can add a p-value column using the conversion methods from the t-statistic which we learned in Section 3.3.12.\n\n# get coefficients (it's in matrix form)\ncoefficients &lt;- summary(model)$coefficients\n\n# calculate p-values\np_value &lt;- (1 - pnorm(abs(coefficients[ ,\"t value\"]), 0, 1))*2\n\n# bind back to coefficients\n(coefficients &lt;- cbind(coefficients, p_value))\n\n                     Value Std.

An examination of the coefficients and the AIC of the simpler model will reveal no substantial difference, and therefore we proceed with this model.\n\n\n7.2.3 Calculating the likelihood of an observation being in a specific ordinal category\nRecall from Section 7.2.1 that our proportional odds model generates multiple stratified binomial models, each of which has following form:\n\\[\nP(y \\leq k) = P(y' \\leq \\tau_k)\n\\]\nNote that for an ordinal variable \\(y\\), if \\(y \\leq k\\) and \\(y &gt; k-1\\), then \\(y = k\\). Therefore \\(P(y = k) = P(y \\leq k) - P(y \\leq k - 1)\\). This means we can calculate the specific probability of an observation being in each level of the ordinal variable in our fitted model by simply calculating the difference between the fitted values from each pair of adjacent stratified binomial models. In our walkthrough example, this means we can calculate the specific probability of no action from the referee, or a yellow card being awarded, or a red card being awarded. These can be viewed using the fitted() function.\n\nhead(fitted(model))\n\n       None     Yellow        Red\n1 0.8207093 0.12900184 0.05028889\n2 0.8514232 0.10799553 0.04058128\n3 0.7830785 0.15400189 0.06291964\n4 0.6609864 0.22844107 0.11057249\n5 0.9591298 0.03064719 0.01022301\n6 0.7887766 0.15027145 0.06095200\n\n\nIt can be seen from this output how ordinal logistic regression models can be used in predictive analytics by classifying new observations into the ordinal category with the highest fitted probability. This also allows us to graphically understand the output of a proportional odds model. Interactive Figure 7.3 shows the output from a simpler proportional odds model fitted against the n_yellow_25 and n_red_25 input variables, with the fitted probabilities of each level of discipline from the referee plotted on the different colored surfaces. We can see in most situations that no discipline is the most likely outcome and a red card is the least likely outcome. Only at the upper ends of the scales do we see the likelihood of discipline overcoming the likelihood of no discipline, with a strong likelihood of red cards for those with an extremely poor recent disciplinary record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: 3D visualization of a simple proportional odds model for discipline fitted against n_yellow_25 and n_red_25 in the soccer data set. Blue represents the probability of no discipline from the referee. Yellow and red represent the probability of a yellow card and a red card, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Model diagnostics\nSimilar to binomial and multinomial models, pseudo-\\(R^2\\) methods are available for assessing model fit, and AIC can be used to assess model parsimony. Note that DescTools::PseudoR2() also offers AIC.\n\n# diagnostics of simpler model\nDescTools::PseudoR2(\n  model, \n  which = c(\"McFadden\", \"CoxSnell\", \"Nagelkerke\", \"AIC\")\n)\n\n    McFadden     CoxSnell   Nagelkerke          AIC \n   0.1009411    0.1553264    0.1912445 3464.5339371 \n\n\nThere are numerous tests of goodness-of-fit that can apply to ordinal logistic regression models, and this area is the subject of considerable recent research. The generalhoslem package in R contains routes to four possible tests, with two of them particularly recommended for ordinal models. Each work in a similar way to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test discussed in Section Section 5.3.2, by dividing the sample into groups and comparing the observed versus the fitted outcomes using a chi-square test. Since the null hypothesis is a good model fit, low p-values indicate potential problems with the model. We run these tests below for reference. For more information, see Fagerland and Hosmer (2017), and for a really intensive treatment of ordinal data modeling Agresti (2010) is recommended.\n\n# lipsitz test \ngeneralhoslem::lipsitz.test(model)\n\n\n    Lipsitz goodness of fit test for ordinal response models\n\ndata:  formula:  discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + country + level + formula:      result\nLR statistic = 10.429, df = 9, p-value = 0.3169\n\n\n\n# pulkstenis-robinson test \n# (requires the vector of categorical input variables as an argument)\ngeneralhoslem::pulkrob.chisq(model, catvars = cats)\n\n\n    Pulkstenis-Robinson chi-squared test\n\ndata:  formula:  discipline ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + country + level + formula:      result\nX-squared = 129.29, df = 137, p-value = 0.668",

    "text": "7.3 Testing the proportional odds assumption\nAs we discussed earlier, the suitability of a proportional odds logistic regression model depends on the assumption that each input variable has a similar effect on the different levels of the ordinal outcome variable. It is very important to check that this assumption is not violated before proceeding to declare the results of a proportional odds model valid. There are two common approaches to validating the proportional odds assumption, and we will go through each of them here.\n\n7.3.1 Sighting the coefficients of stratified binomial models\nAs we learned above, proportional odds regression models effectively act as a series of stratified binomial models under the assumption that the ‘slope’ of the logistic function of each stratified model is the same. We can verify this by actually running stratified binomial models on our data and checking for similar coefficients on our input variables. Let’s use our walkthrough example to illustrate.\nLet’s create two columns with binary values to correspond to the two higher levels of our ordinal variable.\n\n# create binary variable for \"Yellow\" or \"Red\" versus \"None\"\nsoccer$yellow_plus &lt;- ifelse(soccer$discipline == \"None\", 0, 1)\n\n# create binary variable for \"Red\" versus \"Yellow\" or \"None\"\nsoccer$red &lt;- ifelse(soccer$discipline == \"Red\", 1, 0)\n\nNow let’s create two binomial logistic regression models for the two higher levels of our outcome variable.\n\n# model for at least a yellow card\nyellowplus_model &lt;- glm(\n  yellow_plus ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    result + country + level, \n  data = soccer, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\n# model for a red card\nred_model &lt;- glm(\n  red ~ n_yellow_25 + n_red_25 + position + \n    result + country + level,\n  data = soccer, \n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\nWe can now display the coefficients of both models and examine the difference between them.\n\n(coefficient_comparison &lt;- data.frame(\n  yellowplus = summary(yellowplus_model)$coefficients[ , \"Estimate\"],\n  red = summary(red_model)$coefficients[ ,\"Estimate\"],\n  diff = summary(red_model)$coefficients[ ,\"Estimate\"] - \n    summary(yellowplus_model)$coefficients[ , \"Estimate\"]\n))\n\n                yellowplus         red        diff\n(Intercept)    -2.63646519 -3.89865929 -1.26219410\nn_yellow_25     0.34585921  0.32468746 -0.02117176\nn_red_25        0.41454059  0.34213238 -0.07240822\npositionM       0.26108978  0.06387813 -0.19721165\npositionS      -0.72118538 -0.44228286  0.27890252\nresultL         0.46162324  0.64295195  0.18132871\nresultW        -0.77821530 -0.58536482  0.19285048\ncountryGermany  0.13136665  0.10796418 -0.02340247\nlevel2          0.08056718  0.12421593  0.04364875\n\n\nIgnoring the intercept, which is not of concern here, the differences appear relatively small. Large differences in coefficients would indicate that the proportional odds assumption is likely violated and alternative approaches to the problem should be considered.\n\n\n7.3.2 The Brant-Wald test\nIn the previous method, some judgment is required to decide whether the coefficients of the stratified binomial models are ‘different enough’ to decide on violation of the proportional odds assumption. For those requiring more formal support, an option is the Brant-Wald test. Under this test, a generalized ordinal logistic regression model is approximated and compared to the calculated proportional odds model. A generalized ordinal logistic regression model is simply a relaxing of the proportional odds model to allow for different coefficients at each level of the ordinal outcome variable.\nThe Wald test is conducted on the comparison of the proportional odds and generalized models. A Wald test is a hypothesis test of the significance of the difference in model coefficients, producing a chi-square statistic. A low p-value in a Brant-Wald test is an indicator that the coefficient does not satisfy the proportional odds assumption. The brant package in R provides an implementation of the Brant-Wald test, and in this case supports our judgment that the proportional odds assumption holds.\n\nlibrary(brant)\nbrant::brant(model)\n\n-------------------------------------------- \nTest for    X2  df  probability \n-------------------------------------------- \nOmnibus     14.16   8   0.08\nn_yellow_25 0.24    1   0.62\nn_red_25    1.83    1   0.18\npositionM   1.7 1   0.19\npositionS   2.33    1   0.13\ncountryGermany  0.04    1   0.85\nlevel2      0.13    1   0.72\nresultL     1.53    1   0.22\nresultW     1.3 1   0.25\n-------------------------------------------- \n\nH0: Parallel Regression Assumption holds\n\n\nA p-value of less than 0.05 on this test—particularly on the Omnibus plus at least one of the variables—should be interpreted as a failure of the proportional odds assumption.\n\n\n7.3.3 Alternatives to proportional odds models\nThe proportional odds model is by far the most utilized approach to modeling ordinal outcomes (not least because of neglect in the testing of the underlying assumptions). But as we have learned, it is not always an appropriate model choice for ordinal outcomes. When the test of proportional odds fails, we need to consider a strategy for remodeling the data. If only one or two variables fail the test of proportional odds, a simple option is to remove those variables. Whether or not we are comfortable doing this will depend very much on the impact on overall model fit.\nIn the event where the option to remove variables is unattractive, alternative models for ordinal outcomes should be considered. The most common alternatives (which we will not cover in depth here, but are explored in Agresti (2010)) are:\n\nBaseline logistic model. This model is the same as the multinomial regression model covered in the previous chapter, using the lowest ordinal value as the reference.\nAdjacent-category logistic model. This model compares each level of the ordinal variable to the next highest level, and it is a constrained version of the baseline logistic model. The brglm2 package in R offers a function bracl() for calculating an adjacent category logistic model.\nContinuation-ratio logistic model. This model compares each level of the ordinal variable to all lower levels. This can be modeled using binary logistic regression techniques, but new variables need to be constructed from the data set to allow this. The R package rms has a function cr.setup() which is a utility for preparing an outcome variable for a continuation ratio model.",
